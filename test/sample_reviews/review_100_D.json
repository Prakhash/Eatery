The success of El Bravo is the quality of the food and their ability to put a distinct mark on Mexican standards.  \n\nI ordered the #6: Chicken Tamale Deluxe Combo that included a shredded beef flauta, ground beef taco (with flour shell), chicken tamale with rice and beans.  The flauta and tamale were fantastic.  The green sauce on the tamale top notch.  The flower taco shell was an interesting experience.  It's the first I've had in the style offered at El Bravo.  I prefer the standard corn shell (also offered at El Bravo) but it made for a nice deviation from my typical taco experience. \n\nMy order took longer than I would typically expect but worth the wait.  El Bravo has a smaller staff and all the food is prepared fresh when you order.  This isn't assembly line style cooking.  You can even look into the kitchen from the counter and watch the magic happen.  \n\nThe dining area is of ample size and fit for the solo diner or families.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and attentive.

Our waitress was nice and attentive but she did not introduce herself, .  CONCLUSION:  The restaurant is not well suited for families. It is a noisy sports bar with off track betting.

I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that comments on the poor taste of people in North Las Vegas.  How you can give this place anything over 4 stars is just beyond silly.  The great thing about this place is that it fills a niche that is totally unfilled in the area.  The food is generally decent, even if a little over priced.  The portions are generous depending on what you get.  Be sure to order extra tzatziki sauce for your gyro, as they are very stingy with it here.  The most disappointing part of this place is the atmosphere.  From the outside, it looked like a very nice, perhaps even romantic atmosphere, akin to Macaroni Grill or even the Olive Garden.  The minute I walked in, all of those expectations were crushed.  The environment is much more laid back and cheap than what it seems from the outside. It has an almost fast food feel.  The best thing that I can compare it to is Fazoli's Italian fast food chain for those of you that have been there. At any rate, it's a decent place, but certainly not anything above average.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Fn5-x5IX7CfhCKFYaZGyA"}

Fortunately, I was in the area on business, met the wife and went here for lunch based on the positive Yelp reviews and the fact that she'd been here before and really liked it. GOD I'm glad I did. The first thing that hit me was the smell as we walked in - amazing. I've been to a lot of Indian buffets; this one SMELLED the best. So far, so good. Found our table but as usual with any given buffet, arse didn't hit the chair before I was schlopping food onto my plate. Dhal, channa, chicken curry, aloo gobhi, chicken tikka masala (out when I was at the buffet, but they filled it up pretty quick after), meat and pea samosas, potato pakoras, and a giant laundry-basket-sized rice cooker to scoop from. Flung a few ribbons of raita Jackson Pollock-like (or Ron Jeremy-like, depending on your aesthetic sensibilities) across the heaped plate and back to the table to dine. Out came some garlic naan (better than regular naan!) which was thin and fresh. Making good on the promise of the initial smell, the food was VERY flavorful. Best buffet I've been to. The chicken curry was actually SPICY, not dumbed down. Why the hell does this place have to be ~40 miles from my house? One thing's for sure, I'll be back. Maybe not for a while, but still - Indian Paradise rocketed to #1 on my Indian restaurant list after the first mouthful and I'm pretty sure the same will be the case for any Indian food aficionado that tries it. Word of warning - it may be too much of a punch in the mouth for newcomers to the cuisine - if that's you, I suggest getting your feet wet at Bombay Spice (Tatum and Shea) first before trying this joint. Came out with my gut looking like an alien was going to bust out of it and my tastebuds feeling as though they'd gone around the LHC a few billion times.

However, if I were to ever pick a favorite, I might have to go with Bradbury's.\n\nBradbury's is a cozy little joint right off of the corner of the Capitol on N. Hamilton St.\n\nThe place is small, so seating can get crowded. Sharing tables with other people is encouraged, and you can meet some really awesome people, like a hungover me :p\n\nAnyways, I got a cup of pourover coffee and their nutella banana almond crepe. I went with their medium roast, which immediately warmed (and woke) me up on a cold morning. The coffee was brewed perfectly, and the taste was smooth and earthy. I was enjoying my coffee so much that I almost completely forgot about my crepe.\n\nGood thing my stomach reminded me, and I started digging into my meal. The crepe was folded over itself beautifully, with nutella spread out artfully on top. It was accompanied by a dollop of whip cream and bits of powdered sugar. \n\nThe first bite of the crepe might have been one of the happiest moments of my life. Having been to France and having sampled countless of crepes, I could confidently say Bradbury's makes some of the best crepes out there. The crepe was soft and thin, which most crepes should be, but still firm enough to hold all of its fruits without falling apart, which most crepes fail at. \n\nThe warmed up pieces of banana clung to the crepe like honey, and really meshed well with the texture and taste. There wasn't too much nutella, which most of the time would be a bad thing, but in this case, kept the meal light and fluffy. Speaking of fluffy, the whip cream was definitely the icing on the cake, providing that extra level of sweetness.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KBsLagkr8NN8SCozXI9zvQ"}

Further, large screens are used for showing big sporting events which usually attract large crowds.  \nDepending on what one wants out of a Saturday night out The Three Sisters may or may not be the ideal venue to begin or spend it in.  It is often used as the site of Stag and Hen parties and, therefore, if your looking for a quiet drink and catchup with your friends this probably isn't the place.  On the other hand, if your feeling young and wild this is an ideal place to start the night as its lively, drinks are reasonably priced and service is sufficient for coping with the numbers who flock to its bars on Friday and Saturday nights.  I've been to The Three Sisters several times and always enjoyed myself, however, the atmosphere isn't quite as bustling or friendly as I'd like it to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Zls4XLThHK6sm8NI4_OCEg"}

Nothing too complicated and from the asthetics its nice enough, but it is a burger joint so on to the food....\n\nI guess the bad bit first the Onion rings ewww!! These were swimming in grease and pretty much inedible. I definately would steer clear of these even after a few beers I couldnt imagine them being appealing.\n\nNow one of my favourite items on the menu the cajun fires. The spice mix on these bad boys is amazing!! I dont even like chips/fries, but these are something else. The portion size has decreased, but I actually view that as a good thing because I struggled to finish them last time. To accompany this I grabbed some of the slaw. This stuff was great really fresh tasting and a great accompanyment to the fries.\n\nThe beer is served in a plastic glass which is fine I guess, but I would rather of had a proper glass. This point had me hovering between 3 and a 4 star rating. The beer was kept well and had the distinctive west flavour. \n\nNow onto why we come back here drunk and sober, the burgers. The Missus went for a grilled haloumi burger with blue cheese, jalapenos, and cajun spice.Yep cheese on cheese I am assured it was well good. Myself I went for double cheese burger with all sorts added on, check my photos.\n\nThe toppings for burgers are done in 2 teirs of costing - free or 50p. Make sure you grab the cajun spice on whatever you order. ;D\n\nAll in good service, great burgers and you can get a pint with it.

It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.\n\nI learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.\n\nTheir hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.\n\nAnd that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?). \n\nSo I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, \"Really?\"?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning \"Really?\" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an \"epic fail\". \n\nI'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.\n\nBS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends, \"Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns.\"\n\nLong after the trendy red velvet thing has passed, people will still love going out to breakfast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pPfQ73--Y_h5Or0aqDgEGA"}

Not often does a simple picture cause so much commotion, but since the snapshot in question was of a food truck focused on Northeastern seaside cuisine namely Lobster rolls and other such briny delicacies, foodies began buzzing, posting queries clamoring for further details.  Further information about where to find this culinary treasure or whether it actually existed was thin and the discussion seemed to end.\n\nA quick check of the URL www.mainelobsterlady.com got me a contact number to call which led to a rather pleasant conversation and information as to scheduled appearances.  Today, after almost a month of waiting, I went into stealth mode to get into the Arabian Horse Show (who cares about the horses when there's lobster to eat?) and get myself a lobster roll.\n\nThe Maine Lobster Lady operates out of a very tidy, well equipped trailer.  As you approach you can almost smell the salt air and then theres the menu... Two different styles of Lobster roll, shrimp puffs and lobster chowder to name a few.  Barely able to control my glee, I ordered a tradiditonal lobster roll and an order of shrimp puffs.\n\nServed on a hot, butter grilled roll sat easily a half pound of some of the best prepared, most succulent lobster i've ever eaten.  This sandwich is the epitome of simplicity with the barest hint of lemon aioli, chunky lobster tail and claw meat and a buttery sweet roll. I cant even begin to describe how tasty this sandwich was and the $18 price was well worth it.\n\nTo accompany my sandwich were an order of \"shrimp puffs\" ($8.50), think of hushpuppies stuffed with succulent bay shrimp, a crunchy exterior and soft, well seasoned, piping hot interior.  Oh yeah, this was just melt in your mouth delicious when dipped in creamy tartar sauce.\n\nI dont know if you have any interest in horses but if you value your tastebuds and the happiness of your belly, get out to the horse show or find the Maine Lobster Lady at one of her other events this spring and indulge, If you arent able to find her, stay tuned as I eat my way through her menu.

I'm glad we finally got a good Brazilian steak house in Pittsburgh!  I've been to the other two in PGH and the food and service do not come close to comparing.  I've been to Fogo De Chao (multiple cities), Chima, and a few other Brazilian Steakhouse as I travel the county for my job and this is right up there with them in food quality and service.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers are saying about the bad service, but the service here was awesome.  They were fast and dealt extremely well with getting the meat we wanted as well as cooked to the right temperature for various likings at our table.  Simply put....I'll be back.  Can't say the same for the greenforest cafe or the palms.  \nbtw...my wife is originally from Brazil and I've eaten at Churrascaria in Sao Paulo and Rio in addition to all the chains here in the USA, so I can confidently say this is definitely one of the better ones!", "type": "review", "business_id": "63rmr1oM0BbAXcUfNEaieQ"}

Love this place!!!!!!\n\nI LOVE the 800 Degrees in LA, so I was super excited to find this restaurant on the strip!\n\nAll the pizza options are awesome....I especially loved the verde one, cause I'm a sucker for green sauce. \n\nThe toppings are yummy and fresh.....love the capers and kalamata olives. If you like spicy pizza, DEFINITELY get the chili sauce topping! It's to die for!  I even bought a bottle of the chili sauce on my 3rd visit here. \n\nEXTRA plus......it's walking distance from Aria.....so you can get great drinks and then head to 800 Degrees for a satisfying dinner :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "OsMRIq2-M9jMVVPFiqp4sA"}
