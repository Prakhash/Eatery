I had the breakfast special with 2 scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Nothing fancy, but you could tell the guy at the grill had the experience of cooking many a breakfast like this over the years. Very inexpensive too.

Seriously - this place will never fall off the radar again.\n\nWe had two specials that night: Short Ribs with Canneloni (maybe the best canneloni I have ever had) and the Red Snapper in a lemon piccata with a side of linguine.

PART 1\n\n   My review will be overwhelmingly thorough, to aid others I will post in a 'bullet point' format for ease of reference (I have enjoyed this restaurant approximately 10 times in the last year (I am a foodie what can I say)...\n\nHistory- Michelina immigrated approximately 29 years ago and opened her wonderful \"Ristorante\"(more on what this means later) and blessed Phoenix approximately 27 years ago...\n\nFood- Excellent! Italian food from the area of NAPLES (this is where Michelina is from)... Food from this region is a blend, \"Campania is one of the largest producers and consumers of pasta in Italy, especially spaghetti. In the regional cuisine, pasta is prepared in various styles that can feature tomato sauce, cheese, clams and shellfish.(Wikipedia)\" PUTNESCA IS A POPULAR SAUCE from Naples...\n\nRecommendations for food: One SHOULD attempt to incorporate seafood/shellfish as a choice; however, Michelina's has many excellent 'Turf' options (osso bucco, veal, eggplant, etc...)...\n\nAppetizers: Escargots (dip the bread for garlic and butter lovers, this is the best)\n\nOysters Michelina-fantastic\n\nSALAD IS OFFERED COMPLIMENTARY (FYI)\n\nThe bread is exquisite (with butter how its meant to be churned)\n\nEntrees:\nSurf: Many fresh fish specials usually served ala Putnesca (fantastic)\nTurf: Osso Bucco (frequent special, this meat will fall off the shank and is incredibly tender, flavorful, and moist), Veal Saltimbucco, Veal Piccata\n\n\nDessert-  zabaione (with fresh berries) by far the best!!!!\nTiramasu- not bad but do yourself a favor and get the Zabione\n\nA complimentary cordial is provided (fyi)\n\nREAL ITALIAN MASCULINE COFFEE (go espresso or Cappuccino and you will be pleased (don't expect fu fu starbucks)\n\n\nDining EXPERIENCE- In Italy one enjoys the 'TABLE' for the evening (i.e. it is not a rushed affair, rather something to be savored and relished in)....(Notice it is an Italian named Restaurant (not Michelina's Restaurant) but rather \"Michelina's Ristorante Costa Campagnia\" which means, \"Michelina's [exquisite/higher end] Italian restaurant featuring food from Campagnia\".... \n\nService- Brad is a wonderful and exceptional server... Request him if possible... Additionally, as inferred from \"Dining Experience\" above, this is an Experience to be savored... IF YOU HAVE TIME CONSTRAINTS, IMMEDIATELY INFORM BRAD, they will be accommodated (i.e. opera, symphony, movie, or just want a wonderful meal at a heightened pace).... The service WILL NOT HOVER over you as an American Restaurant will!!!!!! The exceptional service staff wants you to enjoy and relish the evening, as is done in Italy...\n\nAmbiance- The restaurant is classically subtle and expresses the 'family and regional' values of Michelina's experiences in Naples as a young woman.... Some may call it dated, others may suggest classically influenced, and yet those that appreciate the Italian cuisine and experience might suggest that it is \"Old School\" in a \"Marlon Brando\"-esque way... For those of you unfamiliar with Marlon, Michelina's IS HOW A NAPLES RESTAURANT IS?WAS?AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE....\n\nTO CORRECT SOME GROSS MISCONCEPTIONS OF OTHERS I WILL ADDRESS them below...\n\n           \"There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.\"\n\n- The restaurant is 'Unassuming' from the outside, this is a treasure, not to be shared with just anyone... It also looks old because it is, she has been in this location for 20+ years....\n\n\"When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.\"\n\n-Michelina's is not a bar, they have excellent drinks however. Additionally, Michelina's is family run AND the expectation (once you have been their more than once) is to walk in and introduce yourself to Brad or Michelina's son (as you will become friends to dine with)....\n\n\"To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the \"look how good I was\" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.\"\n\n-See Ambiance section above... Michelina is a remarkable woman and created this restaurant from LITERALLY NOTHING 27 years ago... She has won best Italian in AZ/Phx many times and would continue to win (however the same restaurant winning does not sell reviews/publications)...\n\n...To be continued..", "type": "review", "business_id": "DIYHTgM-YGKWOWLzQ4XVhA"}

It's not stuffy or pretentious at all; the waiter was friendly and outgoing, as was the executive chef, who served us our bread and checked in a couple times throughout the meal.\n\nFirst, a very pretty, relaxing atmosphere, including a piano tucked in the corner (live music starts up again September 15th).

Let me also say that I really despise circuses...but loved the decor in this restaurant. Five stars for that. \nWe requested just normal tap water and the wait staff seemed almost annoyed with this selection. Uh, sorry we're not sorry that we won't spend $9 for bottled water? Give us a break. This lead to infrequent refills of our water-- that's a big negative for me as I am the polar opposite of a camel and drink water like I won't have any again for a week. Okay, enough of that rant...\n\nPLUS: We had some delicious salads. A prosciutto & melon salad and the classic Caprese. Big props for these two!\n\nThe bread: Yess, we were fans. One of them tasted like pan pizza crust..the whole table agreed. So good! \n\nMeals:\n--Pappardelle: Wide noodles served with sausage and wild mushrooms. I was looking so forward to this dish, and I think it only fell short in my eyes because of its sauce-- or, rather, its lack thereof. There was NO sauce, just an almost excessive amount of melted butter covering the dish. It was good, but almost a tad bland. My mom and sister enjoyed this dish, though. \n\n--\"Mama Egi's\" ravioli: Either order this as an appetizer, or split this and another dish with someone else at the table. Extremely delicious, but also extremely rich. I couldn't eat more than four or five of these mini raviolis without wanting to stop because it was so rich. \n\n--Quail. I had never had quail before, and my sister's boyfriend ordered this dish. I only had a bite, but I liked what I tasted. He said it was better than what he was used to. \n\nDessert:\nWe ordered the bombolonis (donuts)-- ooh, sugar-covered goodness. Came with a raspberry sauce and a strong chocolate sauce. \n\nOverall, Circo wasn't bad. It wasn't bad at all. It had its strong points, but also fell short in some areas.

The bread rolls are made fresh at Capriotti's every morning using a secret recipe. There are three sandwich sizes: small (9\"), medium (12\"), and large (20\").\n\nThe original concept here was to appeal to the turkey lovers, and it's no surprise that the \"Bobbie\" became the signature sandwich here. Sliced turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing, all homemade. About 10-12 turkeys are roasted each night. Workers usually begin the day's prep from about 5:30 a.m.\n\nAs much as I wanted to stuff my face with a 20\" sandwich, I just got a foot-long Bobbie instead ($8.19). The sandwich is wrapped in white butcher paper. Delicious soft bread here. It's a good thing it's a thick loaf for all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing put into this guy. The cranberry sauce had a slight tartness that worked well with the turkey and stuffing. I found the turkey to be slightly on the dry side. The foot-long sub satisfied my appetite, but I'm sure I coulda handled the 20\" sandwich without any problems.\n\nI'm one of those guys that usually prefers toasted bread, no matter what's on it. Still, I enjoyed having a fresh, soft loaf for this sandwich.\n\nI'm a fan of virtually any establishment that gives me a meal filled with fresh, homemade ingredients. There's no substitute for all those hours of labor. I see awesome hot options like cheesesteaks, meatball subs, and Italian sausage subs. Cold subs include turkey, roast beef, and tuna options.\n\nGreat service and a friendly feel overall.

It's just a comfy cozy kinda feeling to me. \n\nLast time we came it was mid morning and this place was p a c k e d! So this morning we opted to go about 7:30a just after they open to avoid the crowd; and we did just that. We were invited to seat ourselves when we walked in and immediately upon seating we were greeted and asked for our drink order. This was a good start and excited me because after our recent trip to PR I was glad to get great and quick customer service at a home town restaurant. \n\nI ordered the spinach and feta cheese omlet (added tomato); it came with home fries and a bagel with cream cheese. The bagel I loved. The home fries were ok. In the omlet they used fresh spinach which was great, I hate when restaurants use frozen or canned crap. Other than that I didn't really care for the omlet; I'm super picky with eggs and the eggs in this omlet were dry like over cooked, & it had browning on the outside of it which to me is disgusting. My bf had a bagels and lox; he loved it, just like he loves everything. \n\nThe reason I give this place a 3 is because the food here just did not knock my socks off AND because they charged $4.50 for an orange juice, really? After we left I made the bf go around back and see if there was an orange tree back there because that's the only reason I can justify paying that much for a glass of juice, is if the tree is in the back growing those damn things and picked fresh daily. Lo and behold, there was no tree. I'm willing to give another try though sometime in the future.

I don't mean my favorite burger place in Las Vegas either, I mean period.\n\nI've been coming to Sammy's for years now and I have a number of items I circle around on. The Chipotle Burger is wonderful, the Steak Burger is mighty and it's worth combining the two and have yourself a Chipotle Steak burger as well. When I stray away from burger land I have to say that the Italian combo is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I love that thing.\n\nThe meal fries are all awesome and great to share at a table. Make sure you have at least four guys if you're hitting up a large.\n\nOh yes, finally... the shakes--the CUSTARD shakes. These things will kill you but it's totally worth it. DO NOT get a large. Seriously. Don't do it.\n\nBefore going to Sammy's, you need to remember what it is: it's a man food type place. The portions are large, there's a lot of greasiness and fat going on (oh yeah, and runny eggs on some of the burgers). It's also a pit. There's four tables, some of them are uneven and frankly, it adds to the charm of the place.\n\nTip from a long time patron: Don't go to Sammy's and order a regular burger and fries. Don't. It's not because either item is bad but because the menu is WAY more interesting than that.\n\nAdditional tip: If you're an obnoxious customer, do not expect that being obnoxious will get you anywhere at Sammy's. Bryan, the owner, does not care how much you badger, complain or threaten. You may even get mocked by him should you choose to take that approach. I almost hope for this sort of customer whenever I drop in because watching the mayhem that ensues tends to enhance the meal.\n\nI love this place and I almost always eat here with \"the guys.\" There are no salads. There is no \"light\" menu. These are burgers, the way God intended.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j3xNAQtY6nFLeE6p4TpJoQ"}

I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special meal.  I got the 6 course chef's tasting menu.  I made a reservation for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed dinner and time to get to the show.\n\nDavid took my order after answering some questions I had about the menu--a menu I had poured over online.  He was a great help.\n\nThere were five canap\u00e9s delivered shortly after.  They're small and they were quite interesting in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the salad of watermelon and dragon fruit, passion fruit, and basil.  A close second was the paprika-tomato meringue with smoked salmon and black olive agar.  The almond and ginger sable was none too shabby either.  All 5 were excellent!\n\nThe first course was glazed Skate with red miso water, spring vegetables and Paris mushroom duxelle.\n\nThe second course consisted of the 3 small bites--a grilled prawn on spinach velout\u00e9 with garlic and parmesan.  The second bite was a piece of lobster with poached turnip, toasted sesame, and bisque.  The third portion was a cold, soft-boiled egg with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of marinated clams, red ahi tuna, and cuttlefish.\n\nCourse three was Mediterranean John Dory with pink pepper, fine foie gras tart and baby artichokes.\n\nThe fourth course was a palate cleanser.  It was a champagne sorbet which had some salted cucumber and a Campari soaked Red Beet.  I was blown away by the cucumber and sorbet combination.  Fantastic!\n\nCourse five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato, berries on a piquillo pepper reduction, and Bigarrde sauce.  The duck was excellent and the tart fruit with the pepper reduction--another superb flavor pairing!\n\nThe last course was dessert which consisted of 5 different small desserts.  They were a coffee panna cotta with Bailey's, Kahlua, Coffee Gel\u00e9e and lime sorbet.  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was strawberry soup with raspberry and basil, and a \"Bella Vista\" granit\u00e9.  Then a fresh coconut tartlet with iced coconut, cilantro, and celery curls.  The last was a chocolate ganache.  As with the entire meal, the flavors developed in the desserts was wonderful!  Coconut, cilantro and celery--who would have thought?\n\nService was excellent all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my iced tea got low, a server brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn't have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren't so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a server was at the table with a box of Kleenex.  Service with a smile and funny!  The same server also brought me a small Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the menu items.  He had heard me mention to one of the servers that I'd never remember all the things.  The server wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!\n\nThe restaurant is very classy and the view is excellent.  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.\n\nTruly a wonderful dinner, about 2 1/2 hours.

Disagree with that but that's ok. Overall great restaurant and you might get a chance to see a celebrity chef at work.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mDdqifuTrfXAOfxiLMGu5Q"}

Great opener to the first-time visitor. Extremely friendly, courteous, and genuinely enthusiastic.\n\nWe ordered the loaded BBQ nachos, crispy (deep fried\") meatloaf, cheddar cheese grits, fried catfish sandwich, crackling pork shank, and BBQ brisket.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the appetizers. That meatloaf and nacho boulder were a phenom start.... (that meatloaf should be on every deathrow prisoner's bucket list).....\n\n.... then it went sideways and slightly downhill like a 2-bit skateboard park. The catfish was too salty, brisket too dry, and cheese grits too...... out-of-a-cardboard-box tasting. The one saving grace was the pork shank because....... how the heck can anyone screw up pork at a BBQ place?\n\nThe live band was very ordinary (seriously, how do you mess up \"My Sharona\"?), but the highlight throughout the night were the double barrel dancers that kicked their heels throughout the night up in the rafters, as well as waddling and 2-stepping throughout the restaurant...... a very welcomed distraction.\n\nBecause this is an SBE restaurant, on top of the fact that a Vegas bar is expected to be high at these menu prices (yeah they're not cheap folks), my expectations are high, and therefore rating standards are tough on this one. \n\nCocktails were decent, but ridonkulously high-priced for the small quantity, and Bar service was slow. They also need to work on sound engineering and accoustic construction (waaaaay too much audible turbulence for a restaurant), and the air is far too thick. I think it has something to do with fog machines, but whatever it is, airflow is very stale and we eventually left because of headaches.\n\nThat said, I won't take away from the general fun atmosphere of the place. The dancers really brought a great dynamic to the place, and there was no shortage of gawking diners. It was sort of reminiscent of the days when the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders could send any place into a high-octane frenzy when they toured the country and were a one-of-a-kind breed back in the day.\n\nFrom a epicurean standpoint, skip this place if you're expecting anything more than a basic BBQ roadhouse joint. But if you're in the mood for group fun, you'll probably like it. \n\nWill I come back? For partying? Yes. For food?

Service was prompt and friendly and it was only a matter of time before our lunches arrived - Caesar salad with shrimp rolls and a Polynesian chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The Caesar dressing is amazing so I would recommend any of the Caesar salads here.  The Polynesian chicken sandwich was excellent but definitely a little messy so if you are at Hulas on a first date or lunch interview I would skip it.  :-).  For visitors from colder parts of the country, I can see where they would really enjoy the garage doors that roll up for access to the small outdoor patio and to welcome Sonoran breezes.\n\nNot only is the food good here but the atmosphere is great too.

I could eat pasta every night of the week. But when we go out to eat, it's rarely at an Italian restaurant. You see, my grandmother was from Italy and cooked like you wouldn't believe. And because if that I'm a little (lot) picky about the quality of my Italian food. Leaving a hole in my dining out repertoire. Until now!!!\n\nIf my grandmother was alive, even she would love the food at La Fontana!  Took the whole family in on a Thursday for, regrettably, a quick bite. Oh how I wish I had two hours to sit and eat 5 courses of this fresh, authentic Italian cuisine!! We made it fast but it was amazing. First off the ambiance is classic, loads of family pictures on the walls and I'm pretty sure \"The Godfather\" score was playing in the background. We were greeted by Franco, the realist deal around. So warm and friendly, he made the entire experience feel more like eating at a beloved friends house than a restaurant. We had pasta and meatballs for the kids; pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was as good as Grandmas. And that's a BIG deal in my family. I didn't get to taste a meatball before they gobbled them up, but I heard they were tender and tasty. Husband had chicken parm; chicken breast lightly breaded, covered with sauce and melted mozz, a side of rigatoni- cooked to perfection. I had the Penne Alla Puttanesca. It comes with capers and olives, they had no problem adding peas at my request. It was DIVINE. Again with the perfectly cooked pasta in a sauce that had nice deep flavor without being too spicy like some puttanesca. \nWe didn't have time for dessert but I know I will go back and get my hands on their Tiramisu. \n\nFinal verdict: YOU! Yes, you. Go now. Go tonight. Eat at La Fontana every chance you get. I know I will!!! Grandma would be proud! Ciao!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iQ2bbe1xY4XSlpR7hEKDOw"}
