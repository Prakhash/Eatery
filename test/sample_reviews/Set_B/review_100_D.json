Then the selective amnesia sets in... \n\nEnter Groupon. So last weekend I couldn't pass up the Havana Cafe Groupon - Groupons always make me feel just a little bit better about dining out on overpriced Cuban, or any overpriced food/service in general. The one I purchased was for something called \"completas\" - complete family meals to-go for 4, normally priced at $39.95 but going for $20 through Groupon. When I was a kid I lived next door to this Cuban family in LA and I fondly remembered the tower of styrofoam containers filled with black beans, pollo con arroz, plantains, and bread that often accompanied the Sera family when they paid us visits. I was excited so I gave it a shot. At $20, what could it hurt?\n\nThe lady on the phone was very nice. She took the order, asked if I'd like to upgrade the col salad (like a citrus slaw) to a mista salad (mixed greens) for $2.50 more. I declined. I went with the paradise pulled pork with moros and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert. It was ready in 15 minutes. I went to pay and there was some confusion about the value of the Groupon but it was honored in full and I was charged about $3.77 for the tax. I got home only to find that the Cuban bread had been left out. Major bummer! As for the meal - the portions were probably enough to fill 2 adults, assuming they ate every last bite, but the moros, pork, and plantains were all sensational! The col salad I could probably have done without but the chocolate bread pudding was just AH-MAHZING! \n\nAll in all I'd probably skip the completas next time, unless I had the Groupon again, but I'd definitely come back for black bean soup, tapas, and dessert!", "type": "review", "business_id": "yJr24Yy1K6bt2G9fX3_zPA"}

I don't believe I've given 5-stars to an Italian restaurant since Yelping, until now! I can only hope that if you're in Phoenix, and you try any of their locations, your meal will be as great as our's.\n\nAnd for us, the revelation of why this meal was sooo good, went back to the source; fresh ingredients. And how do we know that Tutti Santi cooks with fresh ingredients, like fresh picked basil from their own garden? Because Nina, the 80 year \"young\" owner shared that, and a few other secrets with us, at our table.  \n\nIt might have been the comment that the gnocchi was absolutely as good as my wife's....... and THAT COMMENT was made in front of my wife! The word must've gone from our lips, to the server, to the kitchen......... to Nina herself! Because from then on, it was more than just a great Italian dinner experience. It was a great Italian dinner experience with \"Nina.\" She left the kitchen, and came to our table, sharing some cooking, and life, experiences, and also sharing how she comes into the restaurant as early as 4am, just to make their fresh pastas..... and that great gnocchi. I couldn't believe her energy and spunk! Waiter........ I'm having whatever Nina's having for breakfast!!!\n\nAnd yes, we started by ordering their \"famous gnocchi appetizer.\" You've got to order the gnocchi; either the appetizer or the entree! Enough said on that. We then followed with one of the specials; Penne pasta with chicken and Italian sausage in a pink sauce. It was DELICIOUS... and I could taste the very traditional Italian sausage, which was perfectly seasoned. And the chicken? It was white meat strips that had an incredibly fresh taste, and wonderful texture. Our other dish was their eggplant parm. And just how good was that? My wife commented that it melted in her mouth; the best version of eggplant parm she's ever had. And it came with a very generous serving of spaghetti pomadoro. The pomodoro is a basic red sauce, and in this case, a very \"Roma tomato\" fresh tasting sauce. And because I asked about their meat sauces, the waiter brought me a soup bowl filled with the Bolognese sauce, which I liberally put on both their garlic bread and some of my penne pasta. That could've been a meal in itself. \n\nNina's kitchens prove the adage that, \"...there's no substitute for quality and freshness!\" And she also proved that her affection for great food extends to her affection for her patrons, as she brought us a huge serving of her \"in-house\" tiramisu. It was such a well balanced dessert; \"almost as sweet as Nina!\" Enough said.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hqVbmZNLTdR2y7G7oJu9vg"}

Hey, you have to give them credit for actually making iceberg lettuce taste good!! \n\nSo, I met a girlfriend here for lunch today and we had a great meal and were not made to feel guilty for a hogging a booth for a full two hours. As always, the salad arrived fresh, salad bowls nicely chilled and bread sticks warm and buttery :) I proceeded to eat three full bowls of salad...I swear their croutons actually tasted homemade today, I must have been imaging it, but they were a nice touch. She had the Eggplant Parmigiana and was able to substitute fresh asparagus, broccoli and chopped tomatoes for the pasta. It looked delicious. I had the Capellini Pomodoro which, according to our fabulous waiter, was \"one of the healthiest things on the menu\" (I'm planning to splurge at Filiberto's tomorrow!). It seriously tastes very fresh and healthy (love fresh basil) and I couldn't finish it all.   I have to give honerable mention to the Chicken Alfredo Pizza which was ordered by my dining companion on a previous visit.  Although it probably contains more than 2,000 calories, it is AMAZING....if they don't give you enough buttery, creamy alfredo sauce on the pizza itself, they include a side order for dipping...YUMM!!!\n\nOverall, great service, nice atmosphere and VERY good food.

We went to celebrate my upcoming birthday since he will be traveling on the actual day. \n\nIt was the most disappointing restaurant experience I have had in a very long time. Despite our reservations, we were seated at a rickety table next to the kitchen door. All evening the table shook anytime someone went in or out of the door.

The noise level is very high and we found ourselves having to repeat to the server on a few occasions.   It was not a pleasing atmosphere to have a romantic dinner for 2.  \n\nThe highlight of the evening was they do carry a few local wines,  we choose Childress Vineyard's Pinnacle to compliment our meal.  Although, the wrong bottle was brought the table first.  \n\nThe salad was a bit sad,  iceberg lettuce, with a separate place with a few old looking cherry tomatoes, onion slices, cucumbers and radishes.  The ranch dressing was great, but the salad as a whole was a wash.  \n\nMy husband ordered French Onion soup, he said it was good.  But also mentioned it tasted out of a packet, nothing terribly special.\n\nWe both had steaks, cooked medium rare.

So they brought me a new steak a few minutes later and the manager set it down and said I will wait while you cut into it to see that it is to your liking. A little awkward but okay. Plus that shows a lot of confidence in your cooks. So I cut it open and it was barely less cooked than before. By this time I was done wait sent the manager away so I could eat without being watched over. \n\nSo for $150 bucks (without tip) for 2 people I was far less than impressed with food or creativity of bartender. I can't say I would go back for the price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5IWu0xhlZEopvIz3w7o_3w"}

So go, immediately and sit outside on the patio or have brunch on Sunday under the Atrium. Even if you can only stop in for a drink at the bar facing the strip you will be glad you made the effort of finding it. That is a Parisian experience for sure!! \nAnd in the more traditional event that you would like to eat dinner inside, that too is a romantic endeavor and one that will light your faces up by candlelight and be a beautiful dinner, I promise.\nIf you would like to sit outside it is the only thing that a reservation is not good for. You must come and sign up as they do not hold tables for anyone. However sometimes I will admit to making a reservation, and then if the wait isn't that long canceling it to sit outside.

After looking through the free Vegas dining guide, we decided to go to Andre's based on the fact that it was the only French restaurant that had 3 $$$ instead of 4 $$$$. :)\n\nWhat a find!  We got their two for one martinis.  I got the sweet tea martini (wow, how amazing!) and my husband got the lychee martini.  His was quite strong, but he liked it.\n\nThey serve wonderful bread with three types of butter - tomato, olive, and salted.  Yum!  For appetizers, I got the pear and roquefort cheese salad, he got the esgargots.  amazing!   They served a palate cleanser of pineapple sherbet with huckleberries.\n\nFor dinner, I got the muscovy duck breast and he got the lake whitefish special.  Both were outstanding.\n\nI also think there's a lot to be said for cool decor and attentive but not snooty staff.

Our server suggested 2 of his favorite mixed drink specialties from the bar, I wish I could remember the names of them, they were so good.\n\nFor my app I went with Crispy Lamb Riblets; Sweet Corn Raita, Lamb Reduction, Honeyed Yogurt, Micro Mint. This was delicious. And rather large for an app, it was perfectly cooked, a little crunch on the outside and tender on the inside. My friend ordered the Wild Mushroom Tart; Caramelized Onions, Herbed Imported Goat Cheese, Truffle Essence. This also was delicious, had the perefect amount of every ingredient.\n\nWe both chose the same main course, Pacific Sole Milanese; Creamy Fava Bean Risotto, Garlicky Spinach, Lemon Caper Butter Emulsion, Shaved Fennel Insalata.  Right away I noticed it looked greasy, I think the combination of the Milanese with the caper butter emulsion made this dish very heavy and it covered the taste of the Sole. I kept having to drink water after every bite. I loved the risotto and spinach under the fish, so that's what I ended up eating. Dissapointed because I ended up not eating the fish.\n\nWe both chose the same dessert as well, Tiramisu Cannoli; Cinnamon Spiced Cake, Espresso cream. This was a different twist on tiramsu, which is one of my favorite desserts. It had a good flavor, nothing spectacular.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KjymOs12Mpy0Kd54b7T9MA"}

Despite reserving a party of 20 several days before-hand, we had to wait for more than 40 minutes for our table. Personally in this situation I usually cancel my reservation and go to another restaurant, but when you have 20 people with you, it is difficult to migrate to other places and feel obligated to wait.  I know for sure that next time I come here to not  bring large parties at this place. I gave 3 stars due to poor organization, but will give 5 stars for the food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OE5nAmaSVaopeRS1Cs9Kuw"}

Nothing too exceedingly fancy, but better than mystery meat swimming in gravy. Breakfast offerings usually include waffles, french toast, made-to-order omelettes, and various styles of breakfast meats and potatoes. Lunch and dinner are pretty much the same, with basic fried seafood, pizza, chinese food (which is pretty tasty), with some nights offering crab legs and steaks for a slightly higher price.\n\nThe wait staff is generally nice and attentive.\n\nThe price really can't be beat. As long as you have a player's card, breakfast lunch and dinner are 6-9-12 dollars, respectively. Compared to other buffet offerings, I'm not sure where else you can get a decent breakfast or lunch for under $10.\n\nIn review: It's inexpensive, it's basic.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iixLYn4-HwBUvgS4wQmQKQ"}

I had heard from several friends that it was great but had I gone into the restaurant completely ignorant of things I think I would have been a little confused.  \n\nSunday Brunch is a buffet of a lot of items that I wouldn't really consider breakfast or brunch type food - meatballs, roast beef, roasted veggies, kielbasa, potatoes au gratin. All of these were pretty delicious but I was kind of sad not to see more breakfast oriented items.  That being said, there were several pastries and some grits available in the buffet.\n\nI think the wait staff assumes you know whats going on when you come in but they do explain that eggs, bacon, French toast, and waffles can be delivered to the table.  I believe these servings were meant for more than one person but 3 scrambled eggs and 4 strips of bacon isn't exactly a sharing amount.  Nor is one quarter of a waffle or one slice of French toast.  Of course you can always order more.\n\nI think the price probably ought to be explained up-front, its 20 dollars.  Maybe they could hand out a little information for you while you wait.  I'm not sure, I just wasn't exactly blown away by everything and I thought the buffet items were pretty weird.

I like Baja Fresh, don't get me wrong but I really miss Acapulco when it was at this location and I was hoping for some good ole' East L.A.-esque Mexican food. Sadly, Uno Mas didn't quite deliver. \n\nThe shredded beef tacos were the best part of my meal but they were just OK. Just a tad more flavor to the beef and we could be in business because it was moist and tender. The refried beans were just average. They weren't bad but I think I could have done just as well out of a can. The rice was pretty abhorrent. I seldom go to a Mexican place for their rice and don't hold it against anyone if the rice isn't good but the flavor here was just bad. I can't put my finger on what kind of bad, but it was bad.\n\nSo tacos that could have been better, beans that could have been out of a can and bad rice all adds up to a place that I sadly can't in good conscience recommend.\n\nTo top it off, it took three different visits before I could actually buy any food. The first time I went was after 2:00pm but before 3:00 but they had already closed. The second time they had to close early due to some equipment malfunction (makes me think of Precious, the coffee kiosk lady on \"Come Fly With Me\" for all you BBC viewers).

Thank you for our awesome customer service!\n\nThe restaurant is located on the top floor of where the Miracle Mile shops are. Very easy to get to and accessible from the strip. \n\nOur table of 8 (gratuity already included) placed different orders, but I made out with the cup of gumbo and the Stuffed Shrimp (stuffed with crab). My gumbo was OK. I haven't had a gumbo as good as the gumbo from NOLA unfortunately. \n\nMy shrimp entree ($20) was soooo rich and buttery. WOW, such great flavor! I also tried my Dad's jambalaya and it was spicy! Drink lots of beer!!! I also tried the coconut shrimp, which I enjoyed as well. I had a tempura shrimp and I didn't care for it. There was a weird taste that accompanied it. \n\nThe drinks/cocktails are expensive so expect to pay an arm and a leg for them! I had a Corona and that went well with our savory entrees. We were all so stuffed for dessert. \n\nFun place to catch a meal. I love all the Forrest Gump memorabilia!", "type": "review", "business_id": "cP6pQuoPKIoaFQBa09e-Vg"}

My shrimp tacos were very flavorful the perfect size for lunch. Fresh salsa, guac and chips were always replenished in a timely manner. I can't wait to go back and try some of the margs!

Who knew this mixture of curry, cilantro, sweet chili sauce, and a side of sour cream could taste this good?\n\n3)  When you get to the table, grab the delicious hot sauce bottle and give a couple of squeezes.

I like the idea of a restaurant that has a different theme on each level. I don't believe that all the levels are open yet but we did get a chance to eat at Emporio. \n\nEmporio's thing is meatballs and reminds me a bit of Franktuary in that they have a focus to their food and that food is meant to be ordered in multiples. Franktuary has their hotdogs and Emporio has it's Meatballs. \n\nYou can of course order other things other than meatballs but you can also add  meatballs to pretty much anything which is great fun as well. \n\nThe meatballs were very good and can be made with different ingredients and be accompanied by serval different sauce. So you pick your ball and your sauce and then your dish you want that sauce and meatballs to be placed in. I had the sliders and it was delicious. \n\nI feel the sides were plenty big to share so don't go overboard ordering too many of them. Had the mac and cheese and it was delicious as well \n\nGive it a go, it's a great place grab a bite if you are in the neighborhood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UXlGymo9AduQcq-Q-H16og"}
