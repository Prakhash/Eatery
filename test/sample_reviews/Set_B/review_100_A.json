Most everything is served with an aioli which really puts on the finishing touch.\n\nFor the main entree I had Swordfish Veracruz which was presented as a trio...Rice...Swordfish...Popcorn Shrimp(cocktail style, not fried). AND GET THIS - they garnished the shrimp with ACTUAL POPCORN. Very creative. But most importantly, well balanced spice, perfect portion and incredible flavor. \n\nWe tried three desserts, the Espresso Churros, Pumpkin Bread Pudding and Fried Bananas. My favorite were hands down the fried bananas...they were in a chocolate crepe of sort and had amazing flavor. The Pumpkin Bread was also fantastic...and...well...damn. So were the churros. OKAY I LOVED THEM ALL!\n\nI will be back to try more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YKOvlBNkF4KpUP9q7x862w"}

But par for the course, no. \n\nFirst of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.\n\nLizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. \n\nThe food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the \"big night out\" prix fix menu and chose the \"Fusion\" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. \nIt's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UHh2br86pxndWXELC6B8Cw"}

They have a standard list of sandwiches and many soups to choose from and everything comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and helpful, no complaints there. \n\nI ordered the Vegetarian Sandwich and attempted to order the Cauliflower soup. Sadly, they were just about out of the soup I wanted, so I opted for mushroom instead. What I liked is the numerous amount of soups that are vegetarian friendly. (Comparatively speaking, Paradise's super delicious tomato soup isn't? Imagine my disappointment finding out that.) Anywho!  Boyfriend ordered the Asian BBQ pork and tomato basil soup. Both of our meals came out quickly and were super delicious. The vegetarian sandwich is a pretty easy peasy sandwich, tough to screw up unless you're using gross veggies. \nSide note? The soda fountain is pretty cool. While I rarely drink soda, I definitely enjoy a coke here & there. They have the option of adding Italian syrups to your soda! Instant \"Italian soda\", if you want to call it that..they did. I don't know if I really agree. \n\n The only \"meh\" part of the meal was the chocolate dipped strawberry.

Crucify me all you want, but no ramen place in town has been able to touch Monta. I know they are different type of ramen broth, yada, yada, yada...but no ramen has left me craving for more like Monta has. \n\nThis place is located on the corner of Trop and Eastern, in the Burlington Coat Factory parking lot, next to Baskin Robbins. I met Jaime W here right as they opened. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant clean and simple yet modern. I opted for the tonkotsu miso with extra side of chashu. Jaime went with their Tan tan ramen. My ramen was okay, the pieces of chashu were extremely fatty and falling apart. The broth was very salty without much flavor. I finished my bowl as I felt it was okay, not return worthy, but not gag worthy either. Jaime left practically entire bowl untouched. We also had a side of chicken kaarage of which I could not eat more than one small piece. The meat was just so fatty and poor quality while also drenched in grease.\n\nThe couple next to us with whom we struck up a conversation were not pleased with their food either, and left their bowls practically untouched. Maybe it was just a bad morning?  The prices were reasonable, the server friendly and when asked to split our check she didn't look at u like we just asked her to split an atom. \n\nAlso, don't go bathing suit shopping after eating a bowl of ramen. Just a heads up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qRWqgckimeoZaBaRTyV27A"}

I usually don't write reviews for chain restaurants and franchises, but this place was so good that I think people in Las Vegas should know about it.  At first, I thought this place would be like a Panera.  It serves the same types of food as Panera, but the quality is significantly superior.  \n\nI've been here twice, and each time I got the Pick 2 option for $7.99.  This includes a full-size sandwich and a salad or soup.  I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich both times, and I had the vegetable soup on one occasion and the MangoBerry salad on the other.  All of these items were excellent.  the MangoBerry salad was the best salad I've had in a long time.  It's actually a very healthy salad, but I felt like I was eating candy.  The soup was also really good.  They also have a very extensive soda selection, and additional flavors of syrup that you can squirt into your soda to give it unique tastes.  The complementary chocolate covered strawberry is also a very nice touch.  \n\nThere's a very modern, clean feel to this restaurant.  They have a \"recharge station\" where you can plug in your laptop or cell phone.  It seems like the type of place where they wouldn't mind if you want to come and work on your laptop for a while.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because their employees are a little overly-friendly.  From the second you walk in to the place, there's a person holding the door open for you, and all too eager to tell you about what's on the menu and how to order.  Whoever owns this place would do well to tell the employees to back off just a little and give customers a chance to look up at their menu on their own and take it all in.\n\nThis is definitely a great place with nice atmosphere and good food at great prices.  I'll come here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wehqTDVRZsOkESgAoYBhow"}

It's not the worst, but I'd go with a no dude I don't recommend you try this place. First off the service was not good.  It was that don't pay attention don't care kind of service where I had to get up and go to them to ask for things and when they answered me it was short and blunt, like I was bugging them. And now the food. It was uhmmm... Ok? Im kind of a XLB (juicy pork dumpling) snob. I've had them in LA, china, everywhere. Now I guess for some reason it's hard to replicate or do right but these were not the business. I heard someone tell me that they are just as good as the ones at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia. No. Stop. Not even close. I guess if you've never had them the right way then these might be good? Not sure. But we left without even finishing the dumplings let alone the other food we ordered. And I'm fat. I don't waste food, but this just wasn't worth carrying. At least to us. Put it this way, we left the food there and went straight to get pho after. I don't put down businesses often, check my reviews, but if I can save just one person from making the same mistake I made, well then hell, I can get a little more satisfaction from my next meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3zhQAE8jB3PAgDoL1FjNfw"}
