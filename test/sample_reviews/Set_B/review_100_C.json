Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays. Stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. \n\nThis was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\n\nMy wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\n\nWe started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.\n\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\n\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.\n\nI ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \n\nThe kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\n\nOn a different note, our waitress Susan was very good.

They seated us at 7:30 and as we walked across the restaurant I was a little worried that we were going to the back, but no, we were seated in a great window table for two with a view of the Bellagio Fountains.  The view was awesome.  Good thing because we were there for some time!  This is somewhere you come for a long luxurious meal, if you are in a hurry, you might consider McDonalds.\n\nOur server and busser were friendly and professional, with the busser a little more attentive than the server.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and helped me make my decisions.  I was torn between the baked herb crepes, the moroccan chicken and the arctic char and our server suggested the arctic char very highly.  I'm not a huge fan of cooked fish, but I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did!  My arctic char was cooked rare, which I liked and was served ona bed of roasted beets and some pistachio crumbs.  The only thing that would have made it more delicious would have been if the pistachios were a little heavier.  I barely tasted them.\n\nMy husband had the roasted chicken with Moroccan spices and apricots with quinoa pilaf and I tasted that, too and it was DELICIOUS.  I would totally order that - the flavors are fresh and bursting with tangy-ness.  \n\nWe were happy with the drink selections as they serve Stone beers and they had my favorite champagne, Nicolas Feuillatte Brut.\n\nYou can select what type of bread you want from a tray with a small selection of different types of breads carried by the busser.  I had a baguette and then another piece of softer white bread, and he brought big pats of butter.\n\nFor dessert, I finally got to have my Chef Joho souffle, but I wasn't prepared for so many choices!  I was tempted to go with pistachio, but I ended up selecting Grand Marnier for my souffle flavor and it was delicious.  The souffle itself was soft and pillowy and the sauce made it sweet and custardy on the inside.  It was heaven and even though I've checked this off my to do list, I have to go back for more.  It's that good.\n\nI am now accepting gift cards if you would like to help a poor girl return to a fancy restaurant.  We actually did pretty good and our meal was only $130 + tip.

It wasnt too crowded and the waitress greeted me as though we were old friends. All that I could see were rows and rows of steaming buffet tables.  With that, I didnt even sit down before heading over to a station to grab a plate and begin the feast.\n\nI went straight for the sushi and it was good.  Nigiri pieces were small, but thats fine.  Its all you can eat!  I piled on about 6 pieces and grabbed some peel and eat shrimp and went about my business.  I did the same after that with orange chicken, duck, bacon wrapped shrimp, fried rice, noodles, pork sparerib, and a bunch of other things that looked appetizing.  All this for less than 13 bucks a head!\n\nAnyway, the long and short is that the quantity is crazy!  There must have 60 different items including whole crab and crab legs...even frog legs!  But at the end of the day the quality of all of these items is very, very \"so so\".  The crab legs would never be worth the effort as small as they are nor was the crab.  The peel and eat shrimp werent really worth it either as small and shelled as they were.  The duck was mostly bone and for the fan of frog legs they were tiny.  \n\nThe oriental offerings were fair in taste.  Didnt hold a candle to a Panda Express quality even (Boy...I would love if the would do and \"all you can eat deal\"!)  Nevertheless, they did have some treats that you couldnt find elsewhere like sticky rice in plantain leaf which I always love!  \n\nNow there is no way that you can touch this price for all the items available!  So I have to give them kudos for that.  Its got to be great for kids to be able to try so many things that I sure as heck never tried when I was young...but if you are seeking quality along with your quantity I might sugges heading just a mile or so East to the casino...but it's gonna cost you a few bucks more for the buffet.\n\nIf you are saving room for dessert, dont.  Nothing special in this department other than the soft serve which you can dump on top  of the \"apple pie\" (not really apple pie, but apple filling with some crust on it).  No matter how much you eat we can always save room for soft serve!\n\nOnce again...the waitress was sweet and was very attentive.  I dont normally tip at buffet's but I did since she was right on top of our dirty plates when we were heading up for more.  A definite plus!!!  \n\nSo bang for your buck?  5 stars!  Quality of food? 2.  Total...probably a 3 to a 3.5.  I will be back one day when I skipped lunch and just got done at the gym and am FAMISHED!!!

Restaurant \u00e9thiopien tr\u00e8s chic (mais pas trop cher, quand m\u00eame), avec une d\u00e9coration exceptionnelle (m\u00eame les toilettes valent le d\u00e9tour, possiblement les plus belles toilettes de restaurants de Montr\u00e9al !), le Nil Bleu propose des tables d'h\u00f4te franchement succulentes et une ambiance qui se pr\u00eate \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 des rendez-vous galants ou \u00e0 des sorties entre amis. Je ne saurais trop quoi sugg\u00e9rer sur le menu : tout est bon. J'y suis all\u00e9 deux fois et ai essay\u00e9 un peu de tout.\n\nAvertissement aux gens qui sont d\u00e9daigneux : les plats sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sur une sorte de cr\u00eape qu'on utilise pour enrouler les morceaux de viande et les l\u00e9gumes qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sur cette p\u00e2te. Il faut donc manger avec ses mains et on partage la cr\u00eape avec les autres. Comme je l'ai dit : parfait en couple ou entre amis. Peut-\u00eatre moins avec votre patron ou coll\u00e8gue que vous trouvez un peu grossier et avec qui vous allez manger un midi, faute d'avoir trouv\u00e9 compagne ou compagnon plus agr\u00e9able.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cyibZ2ijuDshKHlQs4IB5w"}

Its tall ceilings and walls made out of windows make it very bright and airy, with its interesting interior, where you can even watch the kitchen make the artisan bread. Also, there is a nice outdoor area for sunny days and smokers. Their food options so far have not disappointed me in the slightest and the service is pretty good too. \n\n The table layout is a bit strange and on busy days, one is squeezed in quite close to strangers. The high ceilings although appealing if they have a live jazz session, increase the noise level. Also, being on a student budget with a taste for quality I do find the prices quite high (it's more like a place to treat myself) In addition, weekends tend to be extremely busy with lots of families and small children so this might not be the place to have a quite read and a coffee at those times.\nTaking all of this into account, Peter's Yard is a breath of fresh air to your usual over-priced bagel and watery coffee- it offers yummy Swedish treats, artisan breads and spreads as well as good coffee, teas , interesting sandwiches and soup.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3WNy4woyh9Ih2wr9UcCo0w"}

I went with two other friends, both foodies as well, both love burgers too! Again, the wait for this place was long, 25 min. but worth the wait. I've found the trend that long lines, means good food :)\n\nThe three of us decided to each get a burger and share. The ones we decided on were the Shogun Burger, Kiki's Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. We started out meal out with two tasty appetizers in the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Both were Amazing! Great start to our delicious meal.\n\nThe first burger was the Shogun burger...$25. Yes, pretty pricey...But we went all out as foodies! This burger was so mouthwatering and delicious I could not believe all the flavors coming out in the first bite! The Wagyu Beef & Unagi was so soft and just melted in your mouth as the buttery miso helped smooth it out even more. There was a sweetness that hit me as well, not knowing what it was at first, I quickly recalled it being the peach and pear. Best tasting gourmet burger I have ever had!\n\nKiki's Burger was a delight as well! I have to say all the burgers were soft and tender and mouthwatering. Just the flavors varied depending on the ingredients...which were high quality. The last on was the Spicy Miso Burger. And of course I enjoyed this one as well because of the spice, still not that spicy, but had a kick to it. And of course the fried egg and garlic making a great taste combination.\n\nWould highly recommend for burger lovers. The flavors of the burgers are Asian inspired, and work very well.

It was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.\n\nAnother reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  The DJ was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  Even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!

Our server Olga was beyond amazing! She is what I would consider the pefection of GREAT customer service. \n\nThe drink menu can be found on a iPad, you can view all drinks, there ingrediants, and make your order on it.\n\nWe started with a platter of delicious breads- a walnut biscotti looking bread, a mushroom truffle oil baked puff bread, and a lemon loaf. From there our 3 drinks arrived- strawberry martini(super smooth), Primms Cup, and The HK Antioxidant.\nWe chose to start with The Kobe beef sliders ($17 for 2, added a third for an additional $8) YUMMMY!!\n\nThe three mains ordered- \nRoasted Beef Wellington $52\n -served with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, red wine demi glace (The infamous, PERFECT!)\nRoasted Chicken Breast $30\n -served with confit leg, apple butter, foie gras wild rice, tikki masala, crispy chicken skin (Super moist)\nFisherman's Grill $48\n -served with maine lobster, mussels, scallop, seasonal fish, vadouvan curry aioli (the seasonal fish was halibut, salmon, and i believe a portion of basa filet) \n\nOlga reminded us to save room for dessert as she had something special in mind! Thats a sure sign something amazing was coming our way, if we had the room to order it. Well let me tell you!! Holy god was it amazing!!\nSticky Toffee with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream \"Brown butter stick\"\nI would go just to eat this again and again and again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mDdqifuTrfXAOfxiLMGu5Q"}

I would recommend to not come in a big group of ten like I did or you will have to endure a two hour wait..... They do have an option to skip the wait time if you pay $20. Yea we weren't willing to wait that long so F IT!!! :)  \n\nThe sushi selection is very lacking to only salmon and tuna so I was a bit disappointed in that since that's usually where I head to first when I hit any buffet.  I do give them points though on their dim sum selection which actually wasn't that bad.  It wasn't as bad as other buffets that serve packaged frozen crap.  Siu mai and ha gow were not that bad at all. Cha siu was bombskis tho.\n\nI probably devoured two plates of snow crab legs, about half were on the salty side and the other half on the sweeter side.  Yea I know it's not great for cholesterol but I never really get a chance to eat it that often, so no bigs!  The shrimp were ok, they did have a slight smell to them but not totally offputting.  Our group stayed for a while past the brunch hour which was rolling into the dinner time so they were putting oysters out on the half shell as well!  I could only eat about 3 since I was so full by then but from what I could remember, they were decent as well.  Not the best but none of them made me sick.\n\nI tend to stick with the proteins and stay away from all the starchy carbs so I can't comment on any of the pasta/rice dishes.  The prime rib was cooked well but the quality was no more than select.  The wait for the carne asada isn't really worth it either. It was good but not ten minutes in line good.  \n\nI think the desserts were somewhat of the redeeming factor of the meal since as I said before, we stayed during the transition from brunch to dinner.  So macarons and chocolate dipped strawberries were on the menu as well as the breakfast type dessert pastries as well.\n\nOur waitress Patty was outstanding and made the experience much more enjoyable.  She was constantly around refillling our mimosas and stayed around to chat with us from time to time and crack jokes.\n\nI would put Bacchanal on level with Bellagio and the Wynn buffets so definitely worth a stop before leaving Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g"}

The waitress hardly knew anything about the menu, the restaurant that she has worked at for the past 10 months. The waitress also came to the table every couple minutes, interrupting our conversation and asking stupid questions, ie \"are you done with your meal?\" as I was putting food in my mouth. \n\nWe were 1 of 2 tables in the whole restaurant that were occupued and they screwed up my order. Not only did they bring me the wrong dish, once they realized it, they told me that the dish I ordered is no longer offered, yet it is still on the menu. I had to wait several minutes for my correct order while the rest of my party at their meal. And then I ate my meal with everyone watching me. Afterwards I was only compensated $4 on the bill. \n\nOn the plus side, the food was good, the ambiance and music were good...However I will most likely never go back to this restaurant again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q2FaJ3zB6ZuGgvqUqhdc_w"}
