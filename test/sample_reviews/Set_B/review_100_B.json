They renamed it because they added more cream cheese, so calling it Diablo would give it that extra edge.  Apparently this burro wasn't enough of an artery clogger just yet.  I didn't know what to get so I decided to get what the Yelp review highlights recommended.  Unfortunately it is not always clear if those highlights are for a positive or negative review of the dish. My quick scan indicated that Pollo Magnifico/Diablo was a good thing, so I went with that.  \n\nPollo Diablo is a deep-fried chicken burro drowning in jalapeno cream and cheese, served with a side of beans and rice.  I took one look at the thing and felt myself getting full and bloated already.  The fried touch made it not quite crispy, just a little greasy.  The inside was tender but hard to really pay attention to with all of the jalapeno cream and cheddar cheese everywhere. I was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree.  Nothing worth taking with me, either.\n\nThe worst part about eating here is that we all just got tired from eating.  They are big, heavy portions.  I looked over at my cousin and his head was propped up in his hands, his eyes drooping.  My sister's tamale was basically a hunk of really heavy and dry cornbread and she was exhausted from eating, too.  This was heavy stuff.\n\nI'm not from the Southwest so maybe I just don't know any better, but for this California girl, I would much rather  eat Mexican food in a dirty hole in the wall in San Jose than to come back here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oqZPXoenkQvAKQJ2pDCo0A"}

First of all, the door's are copper, a fact I find amazing due to my new-found love of this material in Arizona. I can't help it, it just always looks perfect out here. \nSo we headed straight back to the bar area, through the dark wood with brass accents, dimly lit area of the restaurant.

A huge, ornate, wood carved saloon style behemoth (that puts Prescott Whiskey Row's The Palace to shame even!). In this magical place, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale was just $3. I will repeat that: Three Dollars. And they offered FREE happy hour snacks, and good ones at that. Sliders with condiments and chips and salsa. \nJust. Wow.

Well, I stand corrected.  I am torn on whether or not to give it 2 or 3 stars, but went with 2 as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  In fact, for the price, I've experienced A LOT better! We went to the restaurant to try their summer pre fixe menu pairings.  The restaurant was somewhat difficult to locate in the restaurant \"circle\" off Paradise.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by teenage hostesses in fish net stockings.  Not very classy.  We read online that the attire was business casual and we dressed for the occasion, only to find a restaurant full of shorts and t-shirts.  I'm not uppity, and I understand Vegas is by and large casual, but that left something to be desired.  Upon being seated we got a waitress whose appearance was unkempt, and when my fiancee asked a question about the menu she proceeded to start talking over her about the specials of the evening and continue through her spiel.  Upon ordering dinner, I requested a glass of whisky to enjoy with my steak.  The glass of whisky made it out after our meal.  We both ordered our Filet's medium rare, and when they arrived they were more well than rare, and very dry.  The server did request we cut into them to make sure \"they were absolutely perfect\" when they arrived, which was a nice touch.  After much prodding by management, my fiancee agreed to send her steak back for a new one as she didn't want to be a burden or waste food.  The attentiveness was nice, but the steak they brought back the 2nd time (even with my fiancee expressing switch it to \"rare\" instead) was even more cooked than the first.  Let me be clear, the food was not terrible.  However, for the level of reviews this restaurant has, and the prices they command ($200 after tip for the 2 of us), it is hardly 4-star plush worthy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z0kyK8wCBNGkkUT9UrMWcg"}

Not just an ordinary Greek salad, but one piled high with fresh produce and charcoal grilled juicy chicken breast. I knew it would be a task to find one near my Old Town apartment, but one day BF had a gyro craving and off we went. \n\nAfter referencing Yelp, we had narrowed it down to George's Gyros and George's Famous Gyros (I'm in front of Ray's pizza! Famous Ray's? No, just original Jerry!). We actually decided on the non-famous George's, but they were closed on Sunday so our decision was made for us. I'm so glad we ended up here, though-it was delicious! \n\nWe ordered take-out and placed our order at the counter, so we waited about 10-15 minutes which ended up being just enough time to scope out the staff (who have fun with their job which I love!) and the location (with the office door marked \"Pirate\"). We also enjoyed the soda fountain-this is a Coca Cola establishment, hooray! And they have a good syrup-to-soda-water ration which is hard to find. Now, on to the food...\n\nBF's gyro was GINORMOUS and stuffed to the brim with tasty gyro meat. He gave me a bite (so generous!) and it melted in my mouth. He conquered half of it before saving the rest for later, which he said was just as good cold. The fries that came with it were good, but I will warn you that they gave us Hunt's ketchup packets, so make sure you have your own ketchup at hand if you are like me and have an aversion to Hunt's. \n\nMy Greek salad was even bigger than the sandwich-TONS of grilled, moist, juicy chicken on top of a *big* salad. And they accommodated my request for no peppers or olives (which, yes, I know, makes it not a \"Greek\" salad but whateva) which was really cool. There was an abundance of fresh lettuce and veggies, and it was more than enough for two meals. It came with two containers of an oil and vinegar dressing, and hit the spot JUST like my fave Astoria haunts. And it came with garlic bread! Super buttery and crispy and plain delicious. \n\nOh! And the kicker was that both meals came to under $20 including tip, PLUS we got two drinks for free since we checked in with Yelp.

Whereas Asian cultures, all with a high level of Buddhist influence, celebrate the many variations of tofu like Westerners celebrate cheese (there is popular franchise restaurants in China featuring Buddhist cuisine; all tofu, all the time), this place is expressly trying to make vegetation derived proteins and fibers resemble meat.\n\nIn that respect, you can expect your \"sloppy joe\" or \"fish sandwich\" to undergo a bit more processing than a meat-based equivalent, to achieve the same desired goal.  Kind of analogous to how much makeup a drag queen needs to put on, in comparison to someone who is female to begin with; in our case, well the flavor just depends on if you notice the eggplant's Adam's apple or not.\n\nMoney:\nAll that vegetable makeup doesn't come cheap!  The irony is never lost on the Engineer in me that even though there's a roughly 10:1 conversion of pounds vegetation to pounds of meat, you can end up paying so much more for the vegetable \"equivalent\" (debatable, see above.).\n\nAtmosphere:\nIf you're a vegetarian or vegan, you've probably already noticed that there tends to be a bit more malnourished rhetorical bravado within your demographic (skinny hipsters).  \nYou're going to get those here.  In fact, you will probably be seated next to one, and he will probably be having a very opinionated conversation with himself (that his \"friends\" are forced to listen while they wonder why they bothered to go to dinner with this guy anyway) about why the wine this place serves isn't as baseball-glove-flavoured as another vintage.  I'm almost exaggerating, but this guy ruined my appetite more than the food ever could.\n\nDesserts:\nThese babies deserve a separate section all their own.  Thankfully many desserts may use animal-based products, but at least they don't need to feature them.  In that respect, this place really shines for desserts.  Anything off of the dessert menu can stand in its own right, and there is no noticeable flavor nor texture difference between the vegetarian and vegan offerings.  They are also tastier and more unique than many offerings I've had at slightly more \"upscale\" foodie establishments in Madison.  Hell, I think this place may receive better reviews if it just became a completely vegan dessert shopp\u00e9.\n\nDirector's Cut:\nMy opinions of this location are tempered with the fact that I was a vegetarian for two short, hungry years, and I did it out of stubbornness for my best friend, who was one for most of her life, out of sheer love for animals (took me to a county fair, made me hug a piglet, told me to think about him whenever I wanted bacon).\nIn that respect, I disliked this place, seeing its menu offerings as an affront to my stubbornness.\n\nAt the same time, stubbornness can only last so long, and this place was absolutely amazing to my bestie, who's spent much, much longer than I have walking by every other brat and burger joint Madison has to offer.\n\nSo there you have it, take a look at the menu ahead of time, try not to be disappointed by the obvious, cross your fingers that you'll be pleasantly surprised, and if all else fails, jump straight to the dessert!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Sd9exwQrSKcZiN3RAhcAUA"}

I also suggest checking out the specials they have that make a night out with friends affordable as well. \nThe staff is always friendly and I've never had any issues with the several times we've gone. If you've never been and you enjoy cheese and chocolate, give it a try. Plan on spending $30-50/person incl. drinks (unless it's happy hour when it'll be less). I wouldn't suggest this place for kids as they have hot surfaces and pans to worry about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UHh2br86pxndWXELC6B8Cw"}

So it stands to reason that places with only a small handful of 4 or 5 star reviews are met with a bit of skepticism. I wasn't too sure what to expect as we headed into Talavera. All I knew was that it was at the Four Seasons, so we could expect it to be pretentious and expensive. But would it be good??\n\nA resounding YES. This place was hands down the best dinner we had our entire 4 days there. My monstrous rib-eye was cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor. It did not even need the smattering of gorgonzola butter that came with, I would have easily devoured this beauty all on its natural own. My husband's duo-lamb specialty was eaten with great reverence, and that plate was almost licked clean.\n\nA sweet, electric pink prickly pear blended margarita was a nice surprise in a fancy atmosphere that looked like it was made only for expensive wines. Try the Olive bread with the gorgonzola and red pepper spread. Skip the sides if you don't have the room. The ham mac n' cheese was good but I've had better. The charred corn was good, but again, I've made better. Save your appetite for the main event.\n\nThe view here is simply astounding, there is no other way to say it. See my photo. If you are evening dining, you absolutely must sit outside, hopefully along the glass wall to get the best view of the grounds and valley.\n\nMy steak was so good that I didn't even save room for dessert, which is virtually unheard of if you know me. Nevertheless, our tireless and friendly waiter presented the check with two little cheesecake bites on a stick covered in a shell of white chocolate. A perfectly sweet end to a fabulous pre-Anniversary dinner.\n\nOh....and the only thing pretentious was the people sitting next to us demanding their wine, proclaiming their unhappiness, and denouncing our extremely harried (yet competent) server. Seriously, again...what is up with all the bitter people vacationing in AZ??", "type": "review", "business_id": "H9wnP4BIctmRxMq43NPgAA"}

Since this seems to be the closest of their stops to where I live, and my friend strongly recommended the pulled pork, I decided to give it a try.\n\nAs much as I balked at discovering that it was $14 prix fixe, I ate my food without complaints... and after I pondered over it for a while and went home with half of my meal remaining, I realized that I actually liked it. It left quite a good feeling in my mouth. The BBQ sauce comes on the side (do _not_ forget it) so that you can serve yourself to taste, and it works with the tender (but perhaps slightly dry) pulled pork. They also had beef brisket and ribs, and my friend ended up raving about the ribs tonight and proclaiming their superiority over the pulled pork. Go figure.\n\nOf course, the BBQ is not the only thing on the menu. The roasted tomato soup really really works, especially when you let it cool down a little bit, and I think this was what kept my mouth in a state of umami fulfillment all night. The green beans are pretty good (and seem to have some tomato), but I really like the baked beans with kidney and black beans added for texture and flavor variation. Finally, the apple crumbled (which I hear is from Bread and Butter) was awesome, with great texture, dried cranberries, and not too much sweetness (or tartness, surprisingly)..\n\nI wouldn't eat this often since it's not really made for my wallet and I don't buy into the food truck culture, but I would recommend that you give it at least one try if you're in the area, or rather if it's in your area.

We had the mother-in-law with us, who's been on a strict low sodium diet, so what better way to mess with her than take her to a Ramen house ...pure evil. \nI was intrigued by the Tan Tan Men (I prefer Tan Tan Women...groan, I know). Since starting this Ramen quest of mine, I've started to experiment at home with making my own version of Tan Tan (Wo)Men. I was curious how Fukumini's meat compared to Sora's and mine. The flavor profiles of all 3 are very similar with tasting the likeness of Toban Djan (Chili Bean Sauce), sweetness from Mirin and hints of garlic. I think my recipe is pretty close.\nService was excellent and on point. We arrived just before the dinner rush and were seated right away. There was a bit of anxiety on our part during the first few minutes of walking in as the aromas permeating  were quite unpleasant and offensive. But the poopy odor soon dissipated and were replaced by more pleasant cooking bouquets.\nWe started with an order of GYOZA which was the best I've had. It was well seasoned and something better than any of the dumplings I've had in Chinatown.\nThe TAN TAN MEN was delicious! Flavorful rich broth that wasn't too salty and thick noodles that had a nice chew to them. My bowl was the envy of everyone at my table who ordered other varieties such as the Classic Ramen in a chicken based broth and the Tonkatsu Soy Ramen. Fortunately for my MIL, they offered a low sodium version of each broth to save her from sporting kankles. My wife who is a picky eater, which is why I suggested the Classic Ramen, wanted to switch with my bowl of Tan Tan Men after tasting it. Being the picky eater, she gives me her Chashu so I thought it would be a win/win situation. We will probably be back sooner than later so she can get her Tan Tan Women.  The Chashu was very tender. My daughter didn't enjoy her Tonkatsu Soy Ramen as much because she said it wasn't as well seasoned, but getting her nana's accidental order of extra Chashu made up for it.\nI think Fukumini will be a regular spot for us to hit up on cold nights since it's on our side of town and similar to Ramen Sora.

We ordered shanghai noodles with chicken and tofu, Indian butter chicken, & kids meal. I like the thick noodles & it was spicy!!! The Indian butter chicken was smooth, curry yumm taste. I like the fact that they made a kids meal plain brown rice and grilled chicken.\nWhat I didn't like, their Vietnamese coffee...yuk. When user said \"it was to die for\", you've got to be kidding me?!?! I consider myself a connoisseur of Vietnamese coffee and that ain't it!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cd3uJtsQtG3vJ_WLGp7YZQ"}

I was particularly impressed by their commitment to sourcing food locally, and the selection and  quality of the meat offered was outstanding.  The service was impeccable.  Our server, Brian, was friendly and impressively knowledgeable about every item on the menu which he took the time to explain to my dining partner and I.  The ambience was sleek and modern, but relaxed and not the least bit pretentious.  Shortly after we were seated we were offered the choice of flat or sparkling water free of charge and a tray of focaccia bread with butter was brought to our table.  My dining partner and I ordered the kennebec salt and pepper fries as an appetizer, and  the Jumping Beef and the Bavette as our entrees.  All steak entrees are served with a stuffed mushroom, homemade chips and a selection of as many sauces as you'd like.  The accompaniments with the steak selections is certainly a rare find as most upscale steakhouses offer sides ala carte. We  finished off our meal with a decadent caramel and sea salt ice cream sundae that was more than big enough to share. Every dish was delicious, perfectly cooked and artfully presented.  We had all of that food along with three beers and coffee for  $85.00.  There is no way a meal like that for two people would have cost so little on the strip.  I highly recommend Echo and Rig to anyone who wants a wonderful meal, in a beautiful setting, with impeccable service at an extraordinarily reasonable price.  We will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GGyHZtnAA5LBgouB-32ARA"}

As i turned in I saw the bright red decor and the sign Full House BBQ. I slowly passed and I saw Filipino food names and I immediately got excited.\n\nI do feel that Filipino American cuisine is the late comer in the Asian American food culture--but hey at least it is here and it will only get better.\n\nSo first I walked in a was greeted by the titas that work there. I was seated and looked at the menu. I was really impressed as I saw childhood favorites such as tokwat baboy, palabok, pinapaitan, and among other things. This was no Panda Express for Filipino food, this was legit Filipino food served in fine dining style. \n\nI order the tokwat baboy as my starter and the Lechon plate with java rice. Soooo juicey and so good! The baboy (pork) with the Tokwa (tofu) was not chewy, it was tender and well cooked and had the flavors that my dad use to make.\n\nThe lechon plate with the java rice was the delicious meal. The pork belly was well cooked and had the \"oh-so good\" fatty parts that lechon is usually popular for along with the crunchy skin. The java rice have the right garlic flavor to accompany the pork. I also like how the place had the condiments ready on the table where I automatically put the spicy vinegar and chili sauce on my pork belly lechon.\n\nDefinitely a fan. I will take my mom here when she visits LV.\n\nI want to try their Mami soups too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fhNeE1t82gn3VksmsJfLXQ"}

The only reason I got 3 stars is because it is a really cool concept with the tree in the middle of the restaurants. We went late on an off night and the wings were barely edible, however the pork taco was really good.  Price of seems decent, and the service was pretty good for only one bartender.
