Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.\n\nSo, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q"}

It is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great experience, plus the food seems that much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.\n\nMy nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...\n\nWe were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.\n\nSo basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.  \n\nThe server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw"}

Well, at that time, I visualized this place as a buffet with unappetizing lettuce leafs and drippy salad dressing, like the salad bar in a university cafeteria that I never visited. Given that I was generally skeptical of my vegetarian friend's recommendation and particularly skeptical of how good soup-and-salad can possibly be, the idea of a double date there was ... kind of out of the question.\n\nNow I have the good fortune of living really close to a Sweet Tomatoes. Now I want to go there all the time, whether it is a single, double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple dates!\n\nThings I love about Sweet Tomatoes:\n\n1) Seasonally changing menu. The menu features the freshest ingredients in season and the low price reflects that. Last month I experienced an Asian-inspired buffet, and this week is a potato-fest. I like surprises!\n\n2) Amazing salads. I would have to spend 7~10 bucks on some bland, refrigerated boxed salad from places close to where I work. But why get that if I can build my own delicious salad, for almost the same price (plus other amazing goodies)? The dressing, by the way, is the reason why I don't attempt to make my own salad at home. \n\n3) Warm, yummy cornbread and muffins. In restaurants serving good bread, I would finish a whole basket of complimentary bread before my entree. Yes, I am a carb snob and in desperate need of portion control when it comes to carbs. Here, I love the selection of mini-bite, fresh-out-of-the-oven cornbread, orange/cranberry muffins, chocolate brownies, and blueberry muffins. The are the perfect size, and give me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.\n\n4) Homemade soups. I love all the Sweet Tomatoe chicken soups: the clear-broth chunky chicken noodle soup, and the creamy chicken wild rice soup. I tried the curry lentil soup and I remember it made me very happy. The soup selection changes every time I go but I think the chunky chicken noodle soup is a staple.\n\n5) Helpful, friendly staff. People are super friendly there. They would walk around and give out a plate of warm and gooey chocolate-chip cookies to tables where people almost finish with their meal. The staff not just smile to you, but also talk to you. Each food item is labeled clearly with a description of the ingredients, but apparently I can ask for recipes as well!\n\n*A side note: the staff really care about food hygiene. I noticed one time the lady filling the salad bar had some mushrooms fell outside the tray. She didn't put them  back (even though there were literally on the verge of the salad tray) but threw them away. It is really basic, but I don't think all restaurants have trained their employees to do that.\n\n6) Kid-friendly environment. I always lament the fact that kids don't eat their vegetables. To get them to eat veggies, you probably have to wrap a celery stick in bacon, put on a buttermilk batter, and deep fry it in butter. I think Sweet Tomatoes is helping to change our food culture. I am very proud of the kids I have seen at the Sweet Tomatoes who eat a hearty serving of vegetables before digging into the frozen yogurt!\n\nMaybe I am writing an unnecessarily long review. But I think this place deserves more applause! True, it is not on your Micheline star guide, not the one-of-a-kind neighborhood gem, never featured on Man v. Food or Triple D, and surely not where you would call for an anniversary dinner reservation. \n\nIt is simple, fresh, lovely, inexpensive, and best of all, in moderation. This is where I would go for a weekend brunch when I don't want greasiness and excessiveness in my system.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-JL0CWSLkkzFHZXlctnf8A"}

This place was say decorated by someone with little more skill than me..... I would not say inviting or especially welcoming, but......\n\nI really enjoyed the food here and this is why they get the 4 star.  The only thing that could have pushed them to a 5 would have been better service but this is a fantastic Korean restaurant....Never having had this food until as an adult, I can tell you in beginning I was not impressed and only ate the Korean BBQ,  but about 28 years ago, I was working in Korea and fell in love with the food!\n\nThere are three simply reasons to come here and if the three are speaking to you, move on to another restaurant...\n\nSoondobu - If you like the nice spicy soft tofu soup, this is the place to go!  When yelpers Lisa S. say this is like their mothers pork soondobu or Christopher S give it a good review, I gotta try it.  You can pick the spice level.  And, like Lisa says, this is something like you expect home made from your mom or grand ma. and Like Christopher S says, you have to do the soup, rice mouth, or the rice soup mouth routine to eat this properly!\n\nSamgyetong - Korean Ginseng Chicken - I have spent many a winters in the early days in Korea doing work and it is freezing cold to the bone.  This soup is so delicious, warming and darn right simple that it always harkens in my memory the best of Korean dining family or peasant style.  This is a simple soup.  If you like complex thick soups that are overpowering, this will taste more like hot dishwater to your tastebuds.  However, if you have a delicate palate and very delicate tastebuds, you will know that this dishwater of soups is absolutely more rich and flavorful and refreshing!  The chicken itself is bland as well, it is boiled in water with minimal herbs, but it is so underwhelmingly just right.  It is hard to describe.  Simple yet satisfying. I guess it is like have a grilled cheese sandwich.  Simple yet satisfying....\n\nBan Chan - I love all types of the small dishes of Korean pickled or spiced vegetables and here the selection is the best.  They had gobo, celery, cabbage, white radish, bean sprouts, cubed radish, and watercress.  Yummy.\n\nSo, if any of these are speaking to you, gotta get over here. If not, well, you will probably not care too much for this place.....\n\nGK says....check it out!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Rzg2-ugIG_UxQCN_JqXDcA"}

We got seated right away and asked for orange juices all around. 5 minutes later someone comes to take our order: 2 Classic Breakfasts, Sausage Biscuits, Bucket of Wings, Steak & Eggs, and Breakfast Skins (Potato Skins). Waiter comes back with waters all around, still no orange juice. 15 min later.. Bucket of wings come out; pretty good, not the best but still somewhat satisfying. (Still no orange juice)\n\n20 minutes have gone by no orange juice and still no food at our table. We're getting restless and impatient. Since no one bothered to ask us for refills we asked one of the waiters passing by to see if our food was ready. Another 5 minutes later, our food has arrived. \n\nClassic breakfast - Eggs were cold. Not hot. Not warm. Cold. Tater tots cold. Bacon was the only thing even close to warm.\n\nSausage biscuits - You can tell by the look of congealed formation of skin on the gravy on the biscuits that it was only possible to achieve this look from sitting around too long. Not to mention that the biscuits were getting harder by the second. Hopefully they think twice before putting their biscuits in the microwave. \n\nBreakfast skins - Looks nice. No sour cream?? Potato skins were not even baked long enough, no crisp whatsoever. \n\nSteak & Eggs - Asked for medium rare, came out well done.\n\nAfter all our food was delivered, we had to ask for our orange juices. We couldn't even finish our food because of the low quality of food and service. I don't understand how you can eat at a restaurant and not even get asked \"how's everything tasting?\" \"would you like refills?\" \"everything come out ok?\" not once. \n\nAfter we asked for the check the busboy had was cleaning the table, literally everything while we were still sitting down. Picking up silverware, napkins, dishes, and even wiping it down while we were trying to pay. Couldn't it have waited till after we left? \n\nI would never come back to this God-forsaken place. Worst quality of food. Worst possible customer service. Worst lack of integrity for a restaurant. \n\nSave yourself the time and eat at pinks 2 min away or lobster me down the walkway, you won't regret it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dxY1gl4cO4-rEFATCkFUIw"}

I have never dined anywhere other than on the back patio under the mist sprayers, and even in 100+ degree heat, it is really comfortable back there. \n\nWith all the items you would expect from a Thai menus - like Pad Thai and Panag Curry, Le Thai also incorporates some other delicious flavors.

I can handle, and do enjoy some heat in my Asian-Style favorites, but the spice is often not consistent at Le Thai. I usually get a '4' out '5' when they ask for a preference in spice level.. Sometimes it's perfect, and sometimes it's not spicy at all, and then other times I can't even eat it it's so hot.  \n\nI have been told that they use 'Ghost Pepper' (look it up..its a really HOT pepper,) on the hotter end of the scale.

I had a bacon-infused cocktail that was shaken with a whole egg. Now, I LOVE inventive cocktails. I consider myself somewhat of a cocktail connoiseur (hands down best cocktails ever = Santaella in Puerto Rico). This eggy, bacon concoction was just weird, though.\n\nOn to the main course. My husband had the Heritage Farm Chicken Breast & California Chorizo Sausage. The mole crumb was yummy. But the chicken was so (so, so!) very dry!! So much so, he requested more sauce to help make it palitable (if this had been a larger restaurant, we'd have sent the dish back....we didn't want to hurt their bottom line). \n\nI ordered the King Salmon. I love King Salmon -- I've prepared it many times. The plate was $34 -- not outrageous for King Salmon. And it would have been a steal if it was good.... but sadly it was mushy. The table next to us sat three couples -- each of the wives ordered this dish and I noticed not one ate even half. Again, if this hadn't been a mom and pop operation, the fish would have gone back....\n\nThe restaurant is cute and rustic. Although the tables and chairs feel like they'd be better suited for a diner. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. \n\nWe came to Pittsburgh for a foodie weekend... and had anticipated that this would be the pinnacle. We left, unfortunately, feeling like our time (and money) would have been better spent elsewhere...", "type": "review", "business_id": "4O0GslAIwG_1regXO_UcaQ"}

I bit into the sugar twist first as it tends to be a fave and noticed immediately that there was a slight crisp to it that I had never experienced. The buttermilk was pretty much just a delicious warm biscuit that had been fried twice over in sugar. So bad, yet so very good. The glaze, which is usually my least favorite kind, ended up the real show stopper.  It was like a flaky layered croissant consistency, but with that same oh-so- slight outer crisp that accompanied the rest. Just pure evil really. The Thai tea wasn't my favorite (a little too syrup-y), but the outdoor seating was a bonus, the service was good, and at just under $5 the price was right.

I'd say there are literally only two downsides...the first is parking, and the second is a restaurant layout issue, though not a real problem for our visit during a slower time. The former is what it is...you're not likely to get a spot that's close to the restaurant, but that can be said for most downtown places. The latter issue is simply where the robust wall menu is located in relation to where we ordered. Still not a huge issue...unless it's packed. Then I could see it being tough to order from.\n\nI liked how the idea was setup, though. You pick your crust, your sauce, your topping, etc. It's a fully customizable experience, and it's reasonably-priced.\n\nI got the caprese salad, which was good, and I like the lack of pretentiousness with everything served on pizza trays, a la Fiori's style. The pizza was perfectly cooked. A lot of these neapolitan pizza places that are popping up struggle to cook the center of the pizza so it's not soggy without overcooking the outside of the crust. Our pizzas were perfectly done, though! \n\nWe kept it simple on our visit, but overall the nice service, fair prices, and delicious pizzas make Stone a place worth checking out if you're downtown and have a craving for pizza that won't leave you feeling miserably full of grease. The owner (I'm assuming based on his interaction with guests while making pizzas) was really nice and outgoing, and you could tell he was really interested in what people thought. That mentality will help Stone stick around. I just worry about location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dGpmXpNSvVSnfB65UwfDtQ"}

That's my big complaint about this restaurant.\n\nOnce I managed to order a couple of things, I went with a street style Asada Taco ($1.30), and a plate of three Quesadillas, one with spicy chicken, one with beef, cheese and mushrooms, and one with marinated pork. ($6).  All three were covered with shredded lettuce and bits of cheese, and there was a nice sauce floating around on the plate underneath.\n\nThe serving of chips for the three of us was dinky (even though we were brought a few more later), & they were paper thin.

Nowadays, everywhere you go there is a \"gourmet\" burger.  But, this place is different.  Just from walking in, there is a warmth here.  I couldn't help but watch the staff, and how friendly everyone was.  This is for sure a rareity recently in Vegas, as everyone only seems out for a tip.  I have to mention my server (Karlenda) by name, because I was FLOORED by her.  If I was opening a place tomorrow, I would be trying to steal her away.  Not only was she personable, but she had a perfect knowledge of the menu, and knew every question we could throw at her.  She seemed honestly happy to be there, and to be working.  She made the experience shine before we even got the food.  As for the food, we started with the chicken and soba noodle salad, which was so good we were fighting over the last bite as they were trying to clear the plate.  The thing that impressed me the most was the range of burgers.  Of course, there is the \"boring-middle-of-the-road\" plain burger (which I have nothing against, but I want adventure when I have a burger out somewhere.  So many of the burgers sound good, but I could not stop wondering about the burger with the mango chutney, and so I had to order it.  We also had the spicy hot dog and goat cheese burger at the table as well.  All I can say about the burgers is that there was not a bite left on the table.  They were AMAZING.  I couldn't believe I enjoyed them so much.  As for the hot dog, I am not normally a hot dog person, but it was spicy, delicious, I couldn't believe it.  I had under-estimated this place assuming it was going to be ok food relying on a celebrity name (which happens, sadly).  For dessert I had the banana shake with butterscotch pudding on top.  I let my friends at the table have ONE SMALL SIP, and the rest was mine.  This meal was not only great, but one amazing exprience I can't stop telling people about.

I hardly go too Monta not out of dislike just not someone generally likes too wait. When you have Ramen Sora right down the road not as busy and just as good if not better. Few and far between see Monta. Monta Chaya brought back all the things I first love about getting me some ramen just like back home in da islands. The shoyu ramen broth LOVE it! I love the depth of flavor and the noodles are awesome. The gyoza now that is something sorely MISS. By far all the Ramen places in town been too few but truthfully not all. Monta gyoza is league by itself. I think its cooked too right on and the filling had so much flavor. I also had the kim chee fred rice as side. It was ono. Just had right balance with the kim chee not spicy at all but well rounded with the vegetables and the sauce. I am just happy that Vegas is blessed too add another great Ramen place in town. Now with so many locations not part of town in that find some good Ramen.\n\nThe biggest bonus about this location and if ever need my Monta fix for sure this is location I would go before the original. The food is the same at both locations. Just SO much nicer at Monta Chaya for obvious reason its brand new, LOT more spacious seating from tables too seating at the bar, and like the decor inside very much modern asian theme. The staff was friendly especially since went with my asian persuasian crew five of us in all. They did great job of staying on top of our drinks and everything coming out in timing matter. So if in the area need your Ramen fix Monta Chaya is place too get some!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VO-OXdvcTHnhKhkNjjJDeQ"}

Overall, it was a pretty good experience. Here's how I rate everything:\n\nfood (#19 Pho)-8/10. Great flavor, good portion size for price. My only real complaint here is that the beef was a little fatty and wasn't sliced really thin. I've always liked when places serve the beef in pho paper thin-even if that means I get less beef. The menu lists one size foe $6.95, it's pretty big. You can apparently also order an XL serving, but I did not ask the price.\n\ndrink (Thai iced tea)- 5/10. Ok. I've had much better. $2.50. Probably won't get this again.\n\nService- 10/10- I walked up to the door carrying my son in a car seat, the man working there opened the door and welcomed me with a smile, lead me to a table and grabbed me a high chair. He even put the car seat into the high chair and made sure it was secure before signaling my waitress. She was also great! She must have noticed me struggling with the chop sticks, because she brought me out a fork, then a glass of water when my tea was half gone. I asked for neither but appreciated both. Top notch.\n\nAtmosphere/location: 7/10: I lump these two together because I tend to care more about the later, but I know some people put a lot of value in atmosphere. It is a pretty small place, I think only 7 tables or so. Atmosphere is nothing special, but you are brought you drinks, unlike my usual pho place, which is a small nicety.\n\nI will definitely be going here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J4d0dY8k71Osot0GypK2kg"}
