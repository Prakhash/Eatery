I have been going ever since. This place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down, order from a set menu, and then get served your meal. Here you get to branch out and build your own Mongolian stir-fry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line. There's meat, tons of vegetable selections, other toppings, and various types of noodles to add. But the personalization doesn't stop there. You then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of YC's own personal recipes. At this point, you hand over your bowl to one of their \"grill warriors\" and watch them bring your stir-fry to life on the giant grills. The finished product always is perfectly cooked, has epic taste and flavor because it has EXACTLY what you want, and keeps you coming back! YC's also has crispy wontons, rice, and chopsticks (of course) to complete the meal! This is a place I will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless. Their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful. Not to mention, it is very affordable. I highly recommend everyone to \"mongo\" at YC's Mongolian Grill!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CdOb17NMdQpagyHSxv5mHA"}

From Foot-longs, White Hots, and Bratwurst to Hamburgers, Corn dogs, and Chicken. It all gets thrown on the grill and cooked to perfection.\n\nLike I've said before my opinion is a little biased, Ted's being a childhood favorite of mine.

Honey sesame chicken! Ugh. My boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything. Then I get up to the register. I ask for 2 small drinks. The cashier asks me what size. Small! She rings me up and hands me one cup. I asked for two! So we then had to pay for the second drink... We go to fill up our drinks and there is spillage all over the drink station.\nSat down to eat. The honey sesame chicken was cold. The orange chicken was barely warm. The teriyaki chicken? It was great! Delicious meat, yummy sauce. That was the winner. The fried rice was also good. At times it has been undercooked/crunchy, but they did a good job today. The Panda Passion tea is very good too. Went to get refills before we left and they had made a pathetic attempt to wipe the spill but it still wasn't clean.

So when another friend came into town for the weekend, I decided we should try it out based on their recommendations. \nI knew Spago was going to be pricy, but every dish was about $10 more than I was expecting still. A dish I expected (based on similar surrounding restaurants) to be about $35 was $45 and this was true across the menu. Because of that, we had to skip our appetizers. \nI had the short rib and my friend had the lamb chops. My short ribs were good, but didn't live up to the expectations I had (which were admittedly high). The flavor was great but they were the fattiest short ribs I've ever had so I had to cut large sections out. \nMy friend's lamb chops were fantastic but they came with risotto. This is when things went downhill. The risotto was forgotten at first. They then admitted the mistake and brought some risotto. However, the risotto they brought after they forgot it was undercooked - noticeably undercooked. We complained and they took it back and brought some new risotto. it seemed to be the same risotto but a helluva lot hotter. Maybe they just undercooked a large batch of risotto and scooped out some more undercooked risotto or maybe they just zapped it in a micro. We gave up on the risotto.\n\nThe service was another issue. The chef came out briefly and said how was our meal. He said this before we had gotten any food so he just turned and walked away. Very awkward. And we never had the same waiter. It was someone different doing everything so when we had the issue with the risotto it was very difficult to correct it.\n\nMaybe it was an off night, everyone I talk to seems to love it, and the food wasn't bad, just nowhere near as good as expected.

However, why was seating the guests a mess!  We pay, stand by the actual hostess stand for like another 10-15 minutes.  I don't get it.  Is it that hard to sit down customers?  They have a few hostesses go back and forth to sit down the guests.  At one point, there were three hostesses standing around.  Some how, this system has to change.\n\nNow for the food.  As we goto our table, we pass by the buffet line.  I was looking forward to this as I was reading this was the place to be vs the one at the Bellagio.  Tons of food out, all sorts of ethnicities and flavors going on.  So we get to our table and I had right over to the sushi and seafood booth.  Sadly enough, their sushi selection was poor.  They had four types of rolls out and that's about it.  Nothing special at all.  As we turn the corner, I was pleased to see a huge tray of shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp was not over done, served cold, and done just right.  Right next to this were the king crab legs, wow.  They are already split in half and all you have to do is pull out the meat.  Great stuff here, couldn't complain, although it would have been nice if it was served warm, but whatever.\n\nSo after devouring the crab legs and shrimp, I decide to explore a little.  I walk down to the other end and find some veal short ribs, which were only OK, picked up a piece of their seabass, which was awesome, and kept browsing around for more.  When I mean \"more,\" I thought there would be a better selection of meats and other seafood, but no.  They had a rib roast sitting out, which I got and was decent.  Next to it was a turkey, which they carve for you there.  A colleague of mine got a \"slice.\"  What I mean is they got a thick slice, who slices turkey, especially white meat at about 1/2\" thick???  So again, the food selection wasn't what I had expected.  I want to mention though that the Chinese section had some sweet and sour shrimp, which was very good, not your ordinary \"joe blow\" Chinese lunch box style shrimp.\n\nThe desserts were all pretty decent.  Nothing spectacular.  They are all small bites, so I suggest you try them all.  Of the batch I got, I have to say the creme brulee was my favorite, but not at all the best I've had.  The crepes were a huge disappointment.  I got the apple one and it was nearly raw granny smith apples.  I don't like a tart tasting crepe, sorry.  Service was decent, servers came by and picked up your empty plates and our waiter came around to refill our drinks.  Nothing to complain about here.\n\nOverall, the decor of this place is great and the Wynn did a good job keeping the buffet tables clean and you know you're going to eat some decent quality food.  However, the food selection was not there for me.  The price paid was fine, but I had expected more at the Wynn.  Would I go back?  More than likely, no.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

Standard buffet fare and some non-standard selections as well. Most people gravitate to the crab legs at buffets, I'm more of a prime rib kinda gal. The prime rib here was pretty good. I admit, I grabbed some of the mushroom sauce meant for the Chateaubriand instead of the au jus. I think it was a good choice. \n\nOther items I had were the brussel sprouts (don't judge me), kielbasa and sauerkraut, chicken with a wine/mushroom sauce. All very, very good. Desserts were plentiful. I tried a creme brulee and a puff thing that I have no idea what it was called but it was damn good.\n\nI'm not sure I liked this buffet enough to pay the single visit price and wait in the usually long line. I had purchased the \"Buffet of Buffets\" deal, so it was worth it in this case. \n\nThe food is very good, service was great. As soon as I went up for dessert, a staff member came by and offered me coffee. It's like she read my mind. If you're a multiple plate buffet champ, it's probably worth the wait and the price. If you're like me and a 1-plate wonder, maybe spend your $30 elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rBPQuQgTcMtUq5-RYhY2uQ"}

The Baja chicken sandwiches were a hit, and you can also get them as a wrap.

I like the roll-up front \"garage\"-style door so you can eat/drink outside, and be art of the scene that is walking by.  really open and airy, and they keep the air-conditioning on so it's not stifling hot.

We were all in good spirits, expecting the feast that was to come - until we saw the food. \n\nIn the past, I would struggle to eat a piece of Kaya's nigiri sushi in a single bite.  The chefs cut the fish thick and broad, so that it completely covered its bed of rice.  Not anymore.  The mackerel, salmon, and yellowtail nigiri I received had been reduced to half the size, at least.\n\nThis, in of itself, is not a problem at an AYCE place.  I could overlook it as a cost-control measure, if the quality of the fish had not declined to the same pittance as the portion.  The fish was decidedly old - even a little dry in spots.  The chefs tried to cover up the worst selections with ponzu sauce.  I love ponzu, but on nigiri?  Sacrilege.   \n\nRolls proved more palatable, if only for the multitude of ingredients drowning out the fish..  The only one that was actually delicious was the Spider Roll.  However, the sushi artistry I observed on my earlier visits was missing.   Each roll appeared sloppy on the plate, and the pieces were difficult to pick up intact.  Was the chef too hasty to give a damn about cohesion?  Was it his first day on the job? \n\nI try not to judge too harshly, but I must also add that the avocados were inexcusable.  My avocado lover (an orb-like sculpture of shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and avocado slices) was inedible.  The avocado was so hard and under ripe,  I'm surprised it could be sliced at all.  If the avocados are so petrified that I can't poke a chopstick through a thin slice, why would a chef deign to serve it?  I'm baffled..\n\nThe worst discovery of all was the tuna.  I'm a big fan of tuna.  I *KNOW* what tuna is supposed to look and taste like.  What Sushi Kaya currently serves as tuna is decidedly ANYTHING BUT.  \n\nI don't know what it is, exactly.  My best guess is dyed tilapia.  It has the strangest shade of pink I've ever seen - like a watermelon jolly rancher.  It has almost no flavor at all, and it flakes like a white fish.\n\nTuna:  you're doing it wrong.\n\n\nOther small gripes include the watering down of their miso soup, and an unfortunate switch from their previous brand of green tea ice cream (very flavorful and creamy, with bitter tea notes) to a new brand (bland, too sweet, may as well be vanilla).\n\nI don't know if Kaya is cutting corners, having issues with its supplier, or both, but I don't think I'll be back for a while.  \n\nThe service and ambiance is still pleasant, so it keeps a few points for style.  I knocked them down to two stars, instead of one, in hopes that the restaurant gets its act together.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZxmKA8b7njab1DNzCEU4Ow"}

The papaya salad with prawns tasted authentic but a touch spicy for my dining partner.  We were not offered the '1 to 5' spicy range, but notice the reviews include such a choice.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the salad 'kick' without complaint.  The catfish was presented with a tasty curry-like sauce that worked very well.

I was free to eat anywhere I desired without worrying about dietary restrictions or preferences of dining companions. Nobuo at Teeter House was my first meal in Phoenix. I was directed to this restaurant from positive reviews rating it as a \"5-star cuisine\". After all, the owner Nobuo Fukada from Tokyo received the acclaimed James Beard Award in 2007. \n\nSince Nobuo is considered to be the #1 Japanese restaurant in the area, I feared encountering a busy dinner crowd. Therefore, I made a reservation at the earliest dinner slot, 5pm. I nervously called ahead to confirm that bar seating was available. Then, I jumped in my car and roared out to downtown Phoenix. \n\nWhen I arrived at exactly 5pm, the servers were probably amused to see me. The restaurant was completely empty. As I walked in, several servers were just arriving on their shift! Without hesitation, they seated me in a private wood-floored historic bungalow room and presented a two page tapa menu.\n\nThe servers were polite. I did not encounter anyone Japanese in the restaurant, with the exception of chef Nobuo Fukada. Apparently, Nobuo is not a traditional Japanese restaurant. It is an izakaya-style eatery with heavy American influences in the dishes (think creative east-meets-west Japanese). The dinner menu consisted of 4 appetizers, 8 cold dishes, and 9 warm dishes with prices ranging from $6 to $26.\n\nDue to the high cost of each dish, I was only able to order 2 tapas. I selected the two most popular dishes:\n\n1. GRAPEFRUIT AND HAMACHI ($16)\nThis cold dish consists of 4 thick slices of hamachi (albacore) sashimi gently brushed with white truffle ponzu oil. A thin slice of ginger was applied on top. Each piece of hamachi was wrapped with a slice of avocado and a piece of grapefruit. The citrus ingredients complemented the hamachi. They were served creatively on single-bit spoons.\n\n2. WARM DUCK SALAD ($16)\nA duck salad sounds ordinary but it was prepared with precision that exceeded my standards. It was a hearty warm dish. About 5 to 6 slices of warm duck were served with a bed of grilled greens. The duck was lightly pan seared to create crispy edges. Then, a soy and zinfandei marinade reduction was applied to create a succulent flavor. Although the grilled vegetables can be dry, it can be dipped in the yuzu vinaigrette. This dish exhibited a satisfying variety of texture - crispy and juicy (duck), crunchy (grilled onions and peppers), chewy (grilled greens).\n\nAlthough the dishes at Nobuo were artfully crafted, thoughtful, and prepared with superb seasonal ingredients, like most small plate restaurants, the overall value was borderline poor. Perhaps lunch is more appropriate here than dinner. My dinner exceeded $40 including tax and tip, but my stomach was not full after 2 tapas. After this meal, I had to drive to CherryBlossom in Phoenix for a second Japanese dinner. \n\nI invite you to try Nobuo if $$$$ or a budget is not an issue. Come with a large group of 4 to 6 and splurge on the various tapas. If you come solo, I hope your company will expense the bill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nMHhuYan8e3cONo3PornJA"}

We asked the hostess if we could sit at an empty table near the host stand since there was no room, and we couldn't because apparently a band was going to set up there to play. Stood around for 15 minutes before we even got service from the bar. \n\nWe were sat 5 minutes prior to our reservation time and started off with fried green tomatoes (which were pretty good, but not great). My parents each got soup; one had some soup with beef and loved it, the other had French onion soup, which was pretty delicious (yes, I mooched).\n\nAs for the entrees, I ordered the shrimp and scallop mac daddy and it was to die for.\nMy parents ordered the quail and jambalaya. The quail was mediocre, and the jambalaya came out cold in the middle. You know what that means. My S.O. ordered the catfish, which was mediocre as well. The potatoes that came with it were terrible and overcooked. Even if the dishes were up to par, this place is really overpriced for what it is. $27 for 3 medium scallops and 3 medium shrimp on a bed of glorified mac and cheese...

Pizza Fusion is a chain that concentrates on offering organic ingredients and gluten free options. Their commitment at least according to their branding seems to extend to use being aware of their environment impact, using recycled goods, and not just token vegetarian options of vegan choices. They have lots of locally brewed beer choices also.\n\nThe counter service is pretty straightforward, a runner will bring your food to you inside or out or you can call ahead and pick up your order. I've mainly alternated between their Farmer's Market or Pear & Gorgonzola pizzas as it's summer and I'm in a lighter food. They'll add meat to any option so don't be afraid to try the vegatarian or vegan options if it tempts you. Servings are a fair size I've split the medium with a friend for lunch or eaten a whole for lunch by myself when I forgot to eat breakfast.\n\nSince the ingredients are unique I'd argue one of the other strengths is actually the location. Yes, the Metropolitian has one of the most passive aggressive inducing parking garage designs in Charlotte. The upside of this is the date ideas you launch from here. Meet here for local brews & noms, then rent b-cycles bike and head to Freedom Park and back.

While the kitchen was clean and the staff worked well together, things started to sour for me when I saw a box of Sysco produce come out of the back.

I'm giving Fukumimi a 3 Star reality check.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qRWqgckimeoZaBaRTyV27A"}

I unfortunately didn't take note of all the names of the regional dishes, especially since I went the extra step and googled a few things on the menu to figure out what they were before I ordered them. \n\nCome here if you are looking for a greater depth of options in your Vietnamese cuisine. It's located in the same plaza as Wendy's noodle cafe next door to a Taiwan deli. So much good food in this little area of Vegas!", "type": "review", "business_id": "A6DFzxQT5yBkwBBJsURRWQ"}

It was the night before finals week started, so we decided to go all out. The 5 Sushi Rolls that we got were California, Playgirl, Windy City, VIP and Gold Rush. I voted the Gold Rush my favorite (also the most expensive), then playgirl, VIP, Cali, and then Windy City. I'm not really a fan of fish, so I was a little worried about that, but all of the ones we ordered had fish, and loved them all. \n\nWe got  our food very quickly and everything was gorgeous. The atmosphere was very contemporary and felt like I was in an upscale sushi restaurant in the city. It was nice to have something so close to me at school, and so classy. \n\nWe left feeling full, but not weighed down. Everything was so fresh and beautifully presented. I will be checking out a lot more sushi restaurants from now on. \n\nIt was a little pricey (we wound up paying around $115 for the table) but we left extremely satisfied.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h_usUndeAdHj-wH219-wUA"}

Great food, and very clean environment. After reading the other reviews, I'm not sure what the big deal is about ordering your food standing vs. sitting. If anything you're not sitting at the table waiting for a server to come by, and they do still service your table with a smile. My fave dish is the \"southwest burrito\" yum! The owner Clay is always involved and eager to make sure food goes out fresh and hot! And my favorite thing about scramble, is their dog friendly patio! It's hard enough to find a great breakfast joint let alone a dog friendly restaurant. Combine the 2 and you've got scramble...enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MOye61Ou7gMl680BpsvDiQ"}

Restaurant not very busy.  Chloe was our server, very friendly and bubbly.  I like the variety on the menu.  A good variety where most people can find something to eat.  I ordered the briscuit sandwich.  For $15 i expected a huge sandwich heaping with everything they described on the menu.  What I received was a small bun with maybe 4 oz of meat and two little ramekins of toppings.\nMy wife ordered 2 tacos.  The tacos tasted good but had very little filling in each one.  Again at $5/taco with no sides these are pricey.  We were both hungry after eating our food and ordered pecan pie.  The pie was good whole pieces of pecans on top but no pecans in the filling.  \nA 1/2 hour later after I left I was still hungry.  Not sure where the whiskey comes into play with the name.  They had an extensive beer list but I didn't see a similar whiskey list.  \n\nTreehouse might work as a place to go to after work for a drink but as a dinner destination there are better alternatives.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bfANvTlrA7cpgiRoYjAc0g"}
